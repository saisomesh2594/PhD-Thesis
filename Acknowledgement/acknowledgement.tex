\par First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge and express my deepest gratitude to Maike Sander, Birgit Sawitzki and Sascha Sauer for providing me with this wonderful opportunity to undertake my doctoral work under your supervision. Your warm and generous guidance has taught me so much about the ebbs and flows of research, the importance of collaborations, and the essence of being a researcher. I deeply appreciate the support you have all provided, especially during challenging and uncertain times in my personal life. For this, I shall forever be grateful.\\

\par To Altuna Akalin, thank you for making me part of your group, for giving me the freedom to develop this work, and for providing invaluable feedback and support throughout this journey. To Thomas Conrad, thank you for stepping in whenever I needed a critical eye. Your insights have been indispensable, and your encouragement has helped me stay motivated during the more challenging phases of my research. To my Thesis Advisory Committee - Laleh Haghverdi and Sigmar Stricker, thank you for your regular check-ins on my progress and for ensuring that my thesis remained on track.\\

\par To Matt, Han, Matthias, Ibrahim, Kerstin and Maria, all of whom have guided me on a daily basis throughout the course of this thesis. Thank you for bearing with me through the daily lows and infrequent highs of scientific research. In particular, I owe a debt of gratitude to Matt and Han for our weekly discussions about the projects, for your patience you had as I aligned myself with the broader field and the research questions at hand, and for painstakingly proof-reading and correcting this thesis. Your collective contributions have profoundly shaped this thesis and my growth as a researcher.\\

\par To Kerim, Sarah, and Iza, thank you for everything! As clichéd as it may sound, words truly fall short in expressing the immense love and warmth I've felt from the three of you over the past six years. You have been there from the very beginning of my doctoral journey, and together we have shared countless moments of laughter, joy, sadness, heartbreak, burnout, and depression. Through thick and thin, you've stood by me, no questions asked! Your support was unwavering, especially during times when I was difficult to deal with. Our evening coffee breaks have been a sanctuary where I could be myself and momentarily escape the rigors of academia. The weekend hangouts, birthday celebrations, and both planned and impromptu gatherings will forever hold a special place in my heart. As Dom Toretto would say, \textit{``We are Family''}. To many more adventures!\\


\par To MDC, Charité, BIH and Freie Universität Berlin, thank you for providing an outstanding environment and to perform my research.\\

\par To Tijana, my thesis writing buddy, thank you for pushing me every single day in the past few months. Without your relentless nudges, I might still be staring at a blank page.\\

\par To all the lovely members of the Ohler lab: Pia, Ece, Karam, Henrik, Pascal, Izabel, Vika and others, thank you for adopting me into your group and your social circle. To many more brunches, picnics and celebrations! To all the members of Maike's former lab at UCSD and her current lab at MDC, members of Birgit's lab at BIH, members of Scientific Genomics Platforms and members of Altuna's group, thank you for all the critical inputs and supportive feedback you've provided during the several lab meetings.\\

\par To PhD Reps, thank you for letting me be a part of the vision to build a more supportive and caring community at MDC. To the BIMSB After Hours Crew, thank you for creating such a fun-loving environment.\\

\par To Karthik, my \textit{cheta}, thank you for being patient with me as I rambled my way though numerous heartbreaks, struggles and pain over the last decade. Your inquisitiveness and unfiltered passion for so many things have been a source of inspiration for me many times in the past years.\\

\par To all the wonderful people I've crossed paths with over the years and befriended along the way — Sri, Prakhar, Solenne, Lina, Olga, Kasia, Fede, Nina, Sam, Selin, Laura, Sara and Tomi, thank you for all the great memories. I will cherish every single one of them.\\

\par To Mumma, you are my rock. All of who I am today is because of you, your love, your support, and your sacrifices. And to Babyma, whom I miss dearly every day. This work is dedicated to both of you.\\

\par And, finally, to Berlin, you have my heart.
