	abstract = {Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

Though previous studies showed inflammation is crucially involved in the development of insulin resistance, how inflammation contributes to β cell dysfunction has remained unclear. We report here the saturated FA palmitate induces β cell dysfunction in vivo by activating inflammatory processes within islets. Through a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies, we show β cells respond to palmitate via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway and produce chemokines that recruit CD11b +Ly-6C + M1-type proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the islets. Depletion of M1-type cells protected mice from palmitate-induced β cell dysfunction. Islet inflammation also plays an essential role in β cell dysfunction in T2D mouse models. Collectively, these results demonstrate a clear mechanistic link between β cell dysfunction and inflammation mediated at least in part via the FFA-TLR4/MyD88 pathway. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Simulation results indicate that the model is able to capture the trends that emerge during the progression of the autoimmunity. The multi-scale nature of the model enables definition of rules or equations that govern cellular or sub-cellular level phenomena and observation of the outcomes at the tissue scale. It is expected that such a model would facilitate in vivo clinical studies through rapid testing of hypotheses and planning of future experiments by providing insight into disease progression at different scales, some of which may not be obtained easily in clinical studies.

To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells.

However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly, our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes. As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological and clinical investigations. Bulk RNA-seq data harbors valuable information about gene expression levels from different cell types in tissue samples.

	abstract = {Autoimmunity is a well-known pathogenic component in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The assumption that the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) also encompasses autoimmune aspects is recognized increasingly, based on the presence of circulating autoantibodies against β cells, self-reactive T cells, but also on the glucose-lowering efficacy of some immunomodulatory therapies in T2DM. The identification of these autoantibodies in elderly patients with slowly progressive manifestation of diabetes led to the introduction of a distinct clinical entity termed latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA), which combines features of both T1DM and T2DM. The autoantibody cluster differs in patients with LADA from patients with T1DM, but their presence indicates steady progression towards β-cell death and subsequent need for initiation of insulin treatment in a shorter period of time compared to autoantibody-negative T2DM patients. Autoimmune aspects in T2DM are not solely restricted to autoantibodies and thus LADA. They include the self-reactive T cells or defects in regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have been detected in autoantibody-negative T2DM patients as well. One contributor to the autoimmune activation in T2DM seems to be the chronic inflammatory state, characteristic of this disease. Upon inflammation-induced tissue destruction, cryptic 'self' antigens can trigger an autoimmune response, which in turn accelerates β-cell death. Both innate and adaptive immune system components, specifically macrophages and self-reactive T cells, contribute to an increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory and autoimmune processes. However, the extent to which inflammation overlaps with autoimmunity is not known. Our review focuses on autoimmune involvement in T2DM, with an emphasis on LADA and the humoral immune response, on the involvement of chronic inflammation in autoimmunity, and specifically the role of B and T cells as links between inflammatory and autoimmune reactions. We will further stress the consequences of autoimmune activation for T2DM patients and present novel therapeutic approaches for T2DM management that rely on immune modulation.},

Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in NADH and ATP are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. INS-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism.

	abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The autoimmune response against islet β- cells is believed to result from a disorder of immunoregulation. According to this concept, a T helper 1 (Th1) subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 1 cytokines-interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFβ), dominate over an immunoregulatory (suppressor) Th2 subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 2 cytokines-IL-4 and IL-10. This allows Type 1 cytokines to initiate a cascade of immune/inflammatory processes in the islet (insulitis), culminating in β-cell destruction. Type 1 cytokines activate (1) cytotoxic T cells that interact specifically with β-cells and destroy them, and (2) macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNFα), and oxygen and nitrogen free radicals that are highly toxic to islet β-cells. Furthermore, the cytokines IL-1, TNFα, and IFNγ are cytotoxic to β-cells, in large part by inducing the formation of oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite in the β-cells themselves. Therefore, it would appear that prevention of islet β-cell destruction and IDDM should be aimed at stimulating the production and/or action of Type 2 cytokines, inhibiting the production and/or action of Type 1 cytokines, and inhibiting the production and/or action of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals in the pancreatic islets.},

The human genome encodes three different PKA catalytic subunits and four different regulatory subunits that are preferentially expressed in different organs. In normal adrenal glands all regulatory subunits are expressed, while CPA exhibit reduced protein levels of the regulatory subunit IIbeta. In this study, we linked for the first time the loss of RIIbeta protein levels to the PRKACA mutation status and found the down-regulation of RIIbeta to arise post-transcriptionally. We further found the PKA subunit expression pattern of different tumours is also present in the zones of the normal adrenal cortex and demonstrate that the different PKA subunits have a differential expression pattern in each zone of the normal adrenal gland, indicating potential specific roles of these subunits in the regulation of different hormones secretion.},

Obesity induces the local expansion of resident intra-islet macrophages, independent of recruitment from circulating monocytes. Functionally, intra-islet macrophages impair β cell function in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner. Increased engulfment of β cell insulin secretory granules by intra-islet macrophages in obese mice may contribute to restricting insulin secretion. In contrast, both intra- and peri-islet macrophage populations from obese mice promote β cell proliferation in a PDGFR signaling-dependent manner. Together, these data define distinct roles and mechanisms for islet macrophages in the regulation of islet β cells.},

Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have suggested that cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories in an asynchronous fashion during development. However, observations of cell flux along trajectories are confounded with population size effects in snapshot experiments and are therefore hard to interpret. In particular, changes in proliferation and death rates can be mistaken for cell flux. Here we present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that reconciles population dynamics with the concepts underlying developmental trajectories inferred from time-series single-cell data. Pseudodynamics models population distribution shifts across trajectories to quantify selection pressure, population expansion, and developmental potentials. Applying this model to time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing of T-cell and pancreatic beta cell maturation, we characterize proliferation and apoptosis rates and identify key developmental checkpoints, data inaccessible to existing approaches.},

Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has made significant progress towards the unbiased and systematic identification of cell populations within a tissue, however, the characterization of their spatial organization within it has been more elusive. The recently introduced ‘spatial transcriptomics’ method (ST) reveals the spatial pattern of gene expression within a tissue section at a resolution of a thousand 100 µm spots across the tissue, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple cells. Here, we present an approach for the integration of scRNA-Seq and ST data generated from the same sample, and deploy it on primary pancreatic tumors from two patients. Applying our multimodal intersection analysis (MIA), we annotated the distinct micro-environment of each cell type identified by scRNA-Seq. We further found that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cancer cells have spatially restricted localizations across the tissue, as well as distinct co-enrichments with other cell types. Our mapping approach provides an efficient framework for the integration of the scRNA-Seq-defined subpopulation structure and the ST-defined tissue architecture in any tissue.},

ZNRF3, encoding a cell surface E3 ubiquitin ligase, was the most frequently altered gene (21\%) and is a potential new tumor suppressor gene related to the Î 2-catenin pathway. Our integrated genomic analyses further identified two distinct molecular subgroups with opposite outcome. The C1A group of ACCs with poor outcome displayed numerous mutations and DNA methylation alterations, whereas the C1B group of ACCs with good prognosis displayed specific deregulation of two microRNA clusters.

	abstract = {Pancreatic beta cell failure dictates the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes, with insulin secretion insufficient to overcome peripheral tissue insulin resistance. Over the past 5-10 years, a convincing case has emerged supporting the contribution of islet inflammation to this beta cell failure. IL-1 is central to this insult, impairing insulin secretion in preclinical and clinical studies. Further, islet-infiltrating macrophages are a major source of IL-1 and other cytokines in response to elevated levels of nutrients (glucose, saturated fatty acids), endocannabinoids and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). In this issue of Diabetologia, Butcher et al have further characterised immune cell subsets present in islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-013-3116-5). Increased numbers of CD45+ leucocytes were found in these islets compared with islets from healthy controls, with an elevated proportion of CD20+ B cells within the CD45+ population. Their data also suggest that absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells and CD11b+CD11c+ myeloid cells may be increased in islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes. While many aspects of islet inflammation await further exploration, the study from Butcher and colleagues suggests a role for immune cell-mediated inflammation early in disease pathogenesis, and supports the concept that targeting the immune system may slow continued beta cell demise in type 2 diabetes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We propose that the Pearson residuals from ’regularized negative binomial regression’, where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

Initial work studying β-cells suggested apoptotic β-cell death as a main contributor for the loss of β-cell mass in diabetes. Restoration of β-cells either by transplant or stimulating proliferation of remaining β-cells or precursors would then logically be a viable therapeutic option for diabetes. However, recent work has highlighted the inherent β-cell plasticity and the critical role of loss of β-cell identity in diabetes, and has suggested that β-cells fail to maintain a fully differentiated glucose-responsive and drug-responsive state, particularly in diabetic individuals with poorly controlled, long-lasting periods of hyperglycaemia. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of loss of β-cell identity and conversion in other cell types, as well as how to regain their mature differentiated functional state, is critical to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse these processes. In this review, we discuss the role of plasticity and loss of β-cell identity in diabetes, the current understanding of mechanisms involved in altering this mature functional β-cell state and potential progresses to identify novel therapeutic targets providing better opportunities for slowing or preventing diabetes progression.},

	abstract = {Adaptation of the islet β-cell insulin secretory response to changing insulin demand is critical for blood glucose homeostasis, yet the mechanisms underlying this adaptation are unknown. Here, we show that nutrient-stimulated histone acetylation plays a key role in adapting insulin secretion through regulation of genes involved in β-cell nutrient sensing and metabolism. Nutrient regulation of the epigenome occurs at sites occupied by the chromatin-modifying enzyme Lsd1 in islets. We demonstrate that β-cell-specific deletion of Lsd1 leads to insulin hypersecretion, aberrant expression of nutrient response genes, and histone hyperacetylation. Islets from mice adapted to chronically increased insulin demand exhibited similar epigenetic and transcriptional changes. Moreover, genetic variants associated with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes are enriched at LSD1-bound sites in human islets, suggesting that interpretation of nutrient signals is genetically determined. Our findings reveal that adaptive insulin secretion involves Lsd1-mediated coupling of nutrient state to regulation of the islet epigenome},

	abstract = {Type two diabetes (T2D) is a challenging metabolic disorder for which a cure has not yet been found. Its etiology is associated with several phenomena, including significant loss of insulin-producing, beta cell (β cell) mass via progressive programmed cell death and disrupted cellular autophagy. In diabetes, the etiology of β cell death and the role of mitochondria are complex and involve several layers of mechanisms. Understanding the dynamics of those mechanisms could permit researchers to develop an intervention for the progressive loss of β cells. Currently, diabetes research has shifted toward rejuvenation and plasticity technology and away from the simplified approach of hormonal compensation. Diabetes research is currently challenged by questions such as how to enhance cell survival, decrease apoptosis and replenish β cell mass in diabetic patients. In this review, we discuss evidence that β cell development and mass formation are guided by specific signaling systems, particularly hormones, transcription factors, and growth factors, all of which could be manipulated to enhance mass growth. There is also strong evidence that β cells are dynamically active cells, which, under specific conditions such as obesity, can increase in size and subsequently increase insulin secretion. In certain cases of aggressive or advanced forms of T2D, β cells become markedly impaired, and the only alternatives for maintaining glucose homeostasis are through partial or complete cell grafting (the Edmonton protocol). In these cases, the harvesting of an enriched population of viable β cells is required for transplantation. This task necessitates a deep understanding of the pharmacological agents that affect β cell survival, mass, and function. The aim of this review is to initiate discussion about the important signals in pancreatic β cell development and mass formation and to highlight the process by which cell death occurs in diabetes. This review also examines the attempts that have been made to recover or increase cell mass in diabetic patients by using various pharmacological agents.},

Islet-cells transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach based on in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to insulin-producing cells (IPCs). According to evolutionary stages in beta-cell development, there are several distinct checkpoints; each one has a unique characteristic, including definitive endoderm (DE), primitive gut (PG), posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic epithelium (PE), endocrine precursor (EP), and immature beta-cells up to functional beta-cells. A better understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRN) and associated transcription factors in each specific developmental stage, guarantees the achievement of the next successful checkpoints and ensures an efficient beta-cell differentiation procedure. The new findings in signaling pathways, related to the development of the pancreas are discussed here, including Wnt, Activin/Nodal, FGF, BMP, retinoic acid (RA), sonic hedgehog (Shh), Notch, and downstream regulators, required for beta-cell commitment.

Approximately 40-50\% of intraislet CD4+ T cells expressed the CD25 marker and exhibited characteristics of regulatory T cells including small size, high level of intracellular CTLA-4, expression of Foxp3, and transfer of protection against diabetes. Results from in vivo incorporation of BrdUrd revealed that the generation of a high frequency of regulatory T cells in the islets is due to in situ expansion upon TGF-beta expression.

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

	abstract = {Genetic risk variants for complex, multifactorial diseases are enriched in cis -regulatory elements. Single cell epigenomic technologies create new opportunities to dissect cell type-specific mechanisms of risk variants, yet this approach has not been widely applied to disease-relevant tissues. Given the central role of pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology, we generated accessible chromatin profiles from 14.2k islet cells and identified 13 cell clusters including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell clusters which represented hormone-producing and signal-responsive cell states. We cataloged 244,236 islet cell type accessible chromatin sites and identified transcription factors (TFs) underlying both lineage- and state-specific regulation. We measured the enrichment of T2D and glycemic trait GWAS for the accessible chromatin profiles of single cells, which revealed heterogeneity in the effects of beta cell states and TFs on fasting glucose and T2D risk. We further used machine learning to predict the cell type-specific regulatory function of genetic variants, and single cell co-accessibility to link distal sites to putative cell type-specific target genes. We localized 239 fine-mapped T2D risk signals to islet accessible chromatin, and further prioritized variants at these signals with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. At the KCNQ1 locus, the causal T2D variant rs231361 had predicted effects on an enhancer with beta cell-specific, long-range co-accessibility to the insulin promoter, and deletion of this enhancer reduced insulin gene and protein expression in human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells. Our findings provide a cell type- and state-resolved map of gene regulation in human islets, illuminate likely mechanisms of T2D risk at hundreds of loci, and demonstrate the power of single cell epigenomics for interpreting complex disease genetics.},

	abstract = {This review describes the molecular alterations observed in the various types of tumors of the adrenal cortex, excluding Conn adenomas, especially the alterations identified by genomic approaches these last five years. Two main forms of bilateral adrenocortical tumors can be distinguished according to size and aspect of the nodules: primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD), which can be sporadic or part of Carney complex and primary bilateral macro nodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH). The bilateral nature of the tumors suggests the existence of an underlying genetic predisposition. PPNAD and Carney complex are mainly due to germline-inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A , coding for a regulatory subunit of PKA, whereas PBMAH genetic seems more complex. However, genome-wide approaches allowed the identification of a new tumor suppressor gene, ARMC5 , whose germline alteration could be responsible for at least 25\% of PBMAH cases. Unilateral adrenocortical tumors are more frequent, mostly adenomas. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway can be activated in both benign and malignant tumors by CTNNB1 mutations and by ZNRF3 inactivation in adrenal cancer (ACC). Some other signaling pathways are more specific of the tumor dignity. Thus, somatic mutations of cAMP/PKA pathway genes, mainly PRKACA , coding for the catalytic alpha-subunit of PKA, are found in cortisol-secreting adenomas, whereas IGF-II overexpression and alterations of p53 signaling pathway are observed in ACC. Genome-wide approaches including transcriptome, SNP, methylome and miRome analysis have identified new genetic and epigenetic alterations and the further clustering of ACC in subgroups associated with different prognosis, allowing the development of new prognosis markers.},

Disruption of this process not only results in organ dysfunction but also may trigger detrimental autoimmune responses. The islet of Langerhans consists of the insulin-producing β-cells essential for proper control of body metabolism, but less appreciated is that these cells naturally interact with the immune system, forming a platform by which the β-cell products are sensed, processed, and responded to by the local immune cells, particularly the islet-resident macrophages. Although its physiological outcomes are not completely understood, this immunoreactive platform is crucial for precipitating islet autoreactivity in individuals carrying genetic risks, leading to the development of type 1 diabetes. In this Perspective, we summarize recent studies that examine the cross talk between the β-cells and various immune components, with a primary focus on discussing how antigenic information generated during normal β-cell catabolism can be delivered to the resident macrophage and further recognized by the adaptive CD4 T-cell system, a critical step to initiate autoimmune diabetes. The core nature of the islet immune platform can be extrapolated to other endocrine tissues and may represent a common mechanism underlying the development of autoimmune syndromes influencing multiple endocrine organs.},

While droplet- and well-based methods have significantly increased the isolation of cells for scRNA-Seq analysis, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet-cell and multiplet-cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell-types can appear as hybrid scRNA-Seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. Traditional approaches for detecting doublets, such as assessing the number of sequencing reads, fall short when different cell types with differing levels of transcriptional activity or library amplification efficiency are sequenced. We introduce DoubletDecon ({\textless}https://github.com/EDePasquale/DoubletDecon{\textgreater}). an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic and cell-hashing cell singlets and doublets from scRNA-Seq datasets of varying cellular complexity. DoubletDecon is able to account for cell-cycle effects, and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms (e.g., ICGS, Seurat).

	abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process. Results: We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision.

The experimental results showed that: 1) Higher pesticide's dose used in tea planting will result in higher residue of pesticides in dried Oolong tea leaf samples, but the dose did not affect the degradation rate of pesticide. 2) The degradation of bifenthrin, cyhalothrin, teflubenzuron, flufenoxuron and chlorfluazuron in the leaves of tea trees follows zero-order kinetics with a half-life of 9.3-9.4, 10.2-10.4, 9.2-9.6, 12.1-13.5 and 7.0-8.2 days respectively, suggested that the pesticide's dose and the interval between tea picking and pesticide spraying are two key factors on the residue of fluorine-containing pesticides in dried Oolong tea leaf samples. 3) In comparison with bifenthrin, cyhalothrin, teflubenzuron and flufenoxuron, chlorfluazuron is more difficult to be remained in dried Oolong tea leaf samples. 4) The pesticide residue was not affected by the processing steps except the fermentation step in which the benzoylurea insecticides and bifentrin were partially lost or degraded.

Because ingested sugars and fats can feed into many anabolic and catabolic pathways1, how our bodies handle nutrients depends on strategically positioned metabolic sensors that link the intrinsic nutritional value of a meal with intermediary metabolism.

Integrin β7− mice that lack natural IELs are metabolically hyperactive and, when fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet, are resistant to obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we show that protection from cardiovascular disease in the absence of natural IELs depends on the enteroendocrine-derived incretin GLP-12, which is normally controlled by IELs through expression of the GLP-1 receptor. In this metabolic control system, IELs modulate enteroendocrine activity by acting as gatekeepers that limit the bioavailability of GLP-1.

In particular, obese adipose tissue shows features characteristic of active local inflammation. At present, however, little is known about the sequence of events that comprises the inflammatory cascade or the mechanism by which inflammation develops. We found that large numbers of CD8(+) effector T cells infiltrated obese epididymal adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas the numbers of CD4(+) helper and regulatory T cells were diminished. The infiltration by CD8(+) T cells preceded the accumulation of macrophages, and immunological and genetic depletion of CD8(+) T cells lowered macrophage infiltration and adipose tissue inflammation and ameliorated systemic insulin resistance. Conversely, adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cells to CD8-deficient mice aggravated adipose inflammation. Coculture and other in vitro experiments revealed a vicious cycle of interactions between CD8(+) T cells, macrophages and adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that obese adipose tissue activates CD8(+) T cells, which, in turn, promote the recruitment and activation of macrophages in this tissue. These results support the notion that CD8(+) T cells have an essential role in the initiation and propagation of adipose inflammation.},

A comprehensive picture of the changes during T1D development is lacking due to limited sample availability, inability to sample longitudinally, and the paucity of technologies enabling comprehensive tissue profiling. Here, we analyzed 1,581 islets from 12 human donors, including eight with T1D, using imaging mass cytometry (IMC). IMC enabled simultaneous measurement of 35 biomarkers with single-cell and spatial resolution. We performed pseudotime analysis of islets through T1D progression from snapshot data to reconstruct the evolution of β cell loss and insulitis. Our analyses revealed that β cell destruction is preceded by a β cell marker loss and by recruitment of cytotoxic and helper T cells. The approaches described herein demonstrate the value of IMC for improving our understanding of T1D pathogenesis, and our data lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and follow-on experiments.},

Single-cell RNA-Seq captures molecular profiles but not spatial organization. Conversely, spatial profiling assays either lack global transcriptome information or are not at the single-cell level. Here, we develop High-Density Spatial Transcriptomics (HDST), a method for RNA-seq at high spatial resolution. Spatially barcoded reverse transcription oligonucleotides are coupled to beads that are then randomly deposited in individual wells on a slide. The barcoded beads are decoded and coupled to a specific spatial address. We then capture and spatially in situ label RNA from the same histological tissue sections placed on the bead array slide. HDST recovers hundreds of thousands of transcript-coupled barcodes per experiment at 2 μm resolution. We demonstrate HDST in the mouse brain, use it to resolve spatial expression patterns and cell types, and show how to combine it with histological stains to relate expression patterns to tissue architecture and anatomy. HDST opens the way to 2D spatial analysis of tissues at high resolution.},

This way, a large number of additional markers can still be used to further characterize the heterogeneity of DCs across tissues and during inflammation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Single-cell transcriptomics is rapidly advancing our understanding of the cellular composition of complex tissues and organisms. A major limitation in most analysis pipelines is the reliance on manual annotations to determine cell identities, which are time-consuming and irreproducible. The exponential growth in the number of cells and samples has prompted the adaptation and development of supervised classification methods for automatic cell identification. RESULTS Here, we benchmarked 22 classification methods that automatically assign cell identities including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. The performance of the methods is evaluated using 27 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of different sizes, technologies, species, and levels of complexity. We use 2 experimental setups to evaluate the performance of each method for within dataset predictions (intra-dataset) and across datasets (inter-dataset) based on accuracy, percentage of unclassified cells, and computation time. We further evaluate the methods' sensitivity to the input features, number of cells per population, and their performance across different annotation levels and datasets. We find that most classifiers perform well on a variety of datasets with decreased accuracy for complex datasets with overlapping classes or deep annotations. The general-purpose support vector machine classifier has overall the best performance across the different experiments. CONCLUSIONS We present a comprehensive evaluation of automatic cell identification methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data. All the code used for the evaluation is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/tabdelaal/scRNAseq\_Benchmark ).

Identification of HEV in indigenous human infection and in domestic pig raising the possibility that HEV infection is also a zoonosis. OBJECTIVES/STUDY DESIGN: Molecular detection and epidemiology of HEV in humans (South-East Hungary) with acute hepatitis and in domestic (pig, cattle) and wild (boar and roe-deer) animals (countrywide) by ELISA and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2006, a total of 116 (9.6\%) of 1203 human sera were positive by HEV IgM ELISA and 13 (24.5\%) of 53 samples were also confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. Forty-two (27.3\%) of 154, 11 (34.4\%) of 32 and 9 (12.2\%) of 74 samples were RT-PCR-positive from swine (feces: 22.7\%; liver: 30.8\%), roe-deer (liver) and wild boar (liver), respectively. Except for an imported infection caused by genotype 1, 19 sequences (human: 12, swine: 4, roe-deer: 1, wild boar: 2) belong to genotype 3 HEV. Genetically identical strains were detected in human and roe-deer and in 2 other human clusters. CONCLUSIONS: HEV is an endemic agent in Hungary. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat-products is one of the possible sources of the indigenous HEV infections. Cross-species infection with genotype 3 HEV potentially involves a food-borne transmission route in Hungary.},

	abstract = {The anterior pituitary gland drives a set of highly conserved physiologic processes in mammalian species. These hormonally-controlled processes are central to somatic growth, pubertal transformation, fertility, lactation, and metabolism. Current models, based on targeted immuno-histochemical and mRNA analyses, suggest that each of the seven hormones synthesized by the pituitary is produced by a specific and exclusive cell lineage. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex model in which critical aspects of hormone specificity and plasticity of pituitary cells remain undefined. Here we have applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), in conjunction with a set of orthogonal imaging studies, to systematically map the cellular composition of adult male and female mouse pituitaries at single-cell resolution and in the setting of major physiologic demands. These analyses reveal sex-specific cellular diversity associated with normal pituitary homeostasis, and identify an array of specific hormone enriched cell-types and a series of non-hormone producing interstitial and supporting cell lineages. Unexpectedly, scRNA-seq further uncovers the presence of a major cell cluster that is characterized by a unique multi-hormone gene expression profile. The detection of dynamic shifts in cellular representations and transcriptome profiles within a number of these clusters in response to well-defined physiologic demands suggests their corresponding roles in cellular plasticity. These studies point to an unanticipated complexity and plasticity in pituitary cellular composition that may serve to expand upon current models and concepts of pituitary hormone gene expression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS The small intestine (SI) displays regionality in nutrient and immunological function. Following SI tissue loss (as occurs in short gut syndrome, or SGS), remaining SI must compensate, or "adapt"; the capacity of SI epithelium to reprogram its regional identity has not been described. Here, we apply single-cell resolution analyses to characterize molecular changes underpinning adaptation to SGS. METHODS Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on epithelial cells isolated from distal SI of mice following 50\% proximal small bowel resection (SBR) vs sham surgery. Single-cell profiles were clustered based on transcriptional similarity, reconstructing differentiation events from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) through to mature enterocytes. An unsupervised computational approach to score cell identity was used to quantify changes in regional (proximal vs distal) SI identity, validated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, western blotting, and RNA-FISH. RESULTS Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection-based clustering and visualization revealed differentiation trajectories from ISCs to mature enterocytes in sham and SBR. Cell identity scoring demonstrated segregation of enterocytes by regional SI identity: SBR enterocytes assumed more mature proximal identities. This was associated with significant upregulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress gene expression, which was validated via orthogonal analyses. Observed upstream transcriptional changes suggest retinoid metabolism and proximal transcription factor Creb3l3 drive proximalization of cell identity in response to SBR. CONCLUSIONS Adaptation to proximal SBR involves regional reprogramming of ileal enterocytes toward a proximal identity. Interventions bolstering the endogenous reprogramming capacity of SI enterocytes-conceivably by engaging the retinoid metabolism pathway-merit further investigation, as they may increase enteral feeding tolerance, and obviate intestinal failure, in SGS.},

	abstract = {Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell types can appear as hybrid scRNA-seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic, mixed-species, genetic, and cell-hashing cell doublets from scRNA-seq datasets of varying cellular complexity with a high sensitivity relative to alternative approaches. Importantly, this algorithm prevents the prediction of valid mixed-lineage and transitional cell states as doublets by considering their unique gene expression. DoubletDecon has an easy-to-use graphical user interface and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms.},

Using tools from graph theory, we compute an unbiased quantification of a gene's biological relevance and accurately pinpoint key players in organ function and drivers of diseases.

DoubletFinder predicts doublets according to each real cell's proximity in gene expression space to artificial doublets created by averaging the transcriptional profile of randomly chosen cell pairs. We first use scRNA-seq datasets where the identity of doublets is known to show that DoubletFinder identifies doublets formed from transcriptionally distinct cells. When these doublets are removed, the identification of differentially expressed genes is enhanced. Second, we provide a method for estimating DoubletFinder input parameters, allowing its application across scRNA-seq datasets with diverse distributions of cell types.

A cluster of LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) appeared to be the mature form of conventional DCs and possessed the potential to migrate from tumors to LNs. LAMP3+ DCs also expressed diverse immune-relevant ligands and exhibited potential to regulate multiple subtypes of lymphocytes. Of the macrophages in tumors that exhibited distinct transcriptional states, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were associated with poor prognosis, and we established the inflammatory role of SLC40A1 and GPNMB in these cells.

We sought to determine the contribution of resident islet macrophages to IAPP-induced inflammation and β-cell dysfunction. In cultured islets, macrophages (F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells) were required for IAPP-induced mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. Moreover, IAPP-induced IL-1β synthesis and caspase-1 activation were detected in macrophages but not other islet cell types. Transgenic mice with β-cell human IAPP (hIAPP) expression had impaired glucose tolerance, elevated islet Il1b mRNA, and decreased Il10 and Il1rn expression following high-fat feeding. Islet macrophages were the major source of these transcripts and expressed increased cell surface Ly6C and CD11c in hIAPP transgenic mice. Clodronate liposome-mediated depletion of islet macrophages improved glucose tolerance and blocked proinflammatory gene expression in hIAPP-expressing mice, despite increasing the amount of islet amyloid. These data provide the first evidence that IAPP aggregates skew resident islet macrophages toward a proinflammatory phenotype and suggest a mechanism by which anti-inflammatory therapies may protect β-cells from IAPP-induced islet dysfunction. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.},

Our workflow offers different analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with a phenotype or changes in signaling markers within specific subpopulations, or differential analyses of aggregated signals. Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response; thus, we are able to model arbitrary experimental designs, such as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing overdispersion in cell count or aggregated signals across samples to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step, including quality control (e.g. multi-dimensional scaling plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses (e.g. plots of aggregated signals).},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progresses from compensated insulin resistance to beta cell failure resulting in uncompensated hyperglycemia, a process replicated in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. The Nlrp3 inflammasome has been implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance and beta cell failure. Endocannabinoids contribute to insulin resistance through activation of peripheral CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) and also promote beta cell failure. Here we show that beta cell failure in adult ZDF rats is not associated with CB1R signaling in beta cells, but rather in M1 macrophages infiltrating into pancreatic islets, and that this leads to activation of the Nlrp3-ASC inflammasome in the macrophages. These effects are replicated in vitro by incubating wild-type human or rodent macrophages, but not macrophages from CB 1 R-deficient (Cnr1-/-) or Nlrp3-/- mice, with the endocannabinoid anandamide. Peripheral CB1R blockade, in vivo depletion of macrophages or macrophage-specific knockdown of CB 1R reverses or prevents these changes and restores normoglycemia and glucose-induced insulin secretion. These findings implicate endocannabinoids and inflammasome activation in beta cell failure and identify macrophage-expressed CB1R as a therapeutic target in T2DM.},

RESULTS: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime, the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction efficacy while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are designed for the study: identical cell types with different technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple batches, big data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four benchmarking metrics including kBET, LISI, ASW, and ARI. We also investigate the use of batch-corrected data to study differential gene expression. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, Harmony, LIGER, and Seurat 3 are the recommended methods for batch integration. Due to its significantly shorter runtime, Harmony is recommended as the first method to try, with the other methods as viable alternatives.},

	abstract = {Background: The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data. Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of eleven differential gene expression analysis software tools, which are designed for scRNAseq data or can be applied to them. We used simulated and real data to evaluate the accuracy and precision of detection. Using simulated data, we investigated the effect of sample size on the detection accuracy of the tools. Using real data, we examined the agreement among the tools in identifying DE genes, the run time of the tools, and the biological relevance of the detected DE genes. Conclusions: In general, agreement among the tools in calling DE genes is not high. There is a trade-off between true-positive rates and the precision of calling DE genes. Methods with higher true positive rates tend to show low precision due to their introducing false positives, whereas methods with high precision show low true positive rates due to identifying few DE genes. We observed that current methods designed for scRNAseq data do not tend to show better performance compared to methods designed for bulk RNAseq data. Data multimodality and abundance of zero read counts are the main characteristics of scRNAseq data, which play important roles in the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods and need to be considered in terms of the development of new methods.},

	abstract = {Conventional two-dimensional differentiation from pluripotency fails to recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. Three-dimensional organoids generate complex organ-like tissues; however, it is unclear how heterotypic interactions affect lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in two-dimensional culture. We then derive three-dimensional liver bud organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during liver bud development. We find that liver bud hepatoblasts diverge from the two-dimensional lineage, and express epithelial migration signatures characteristic of organ budding. We benchmark three-dimensional liver buds against fetal and adult human liver single-cell RNA sequencing data, and find a striking correspondence between the three-dimensional liver bud and fetal liver cells. We use a receptor-ligand pairing analysis and a high-throughput inhibitor assay to interrogate signalling in liver buds, and show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) crosstalk potentiates endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Our molecular dissection reveals interlineage communication regulating organoid development, and illuminates previously inaccessible aspects of human liver development.},

	abstract = {Dedifferentiation of insulin-secreting β cells in the islets of Langerhans has been proposed to be a major mechanism of β-cell dysfunction. Whether dedifferentiated β cells can be targeted by pharmacological intervention for diabetes remission, and ways in which this could be accomplished, are unknown as yet. Here we report the use of streptozotocin-induced diabetes to study β-cell dedifferentiation in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of islets identified markers and pathways associated with β-cell dedifferentiation and dysfunction. Single and combinatorial pharmacology further show that insulin treatment triggers insulin receptor pathway activation in β cells and restores maturation and function for diabetes remission. Additional β-cell selective delivery of oestrogen by Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1–oestrogen conjugate) decreases daily insulin requirements by 60\%, triggers oestrogen-specific activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation system, and further increases β-cell survival and regeneration. GLP-1–oestrogen also protects human β cells against cytokine-induced dysfunction. This study not only describes mechanisms of β-cell dedifferentiation and regeneration, but also reveals pharmacological entry points to target dedifferentiated β cells for diabetes remission.},

However, the molecular signatures of immune cell populations over time in an autoimmune process remain poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we performed an unbiased examination of diverse islet-infiltrating cells during autoimmune diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse. The data revealed a landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity across the lymphoid and myeloid compartments. Memory CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells appeared early in islets, accompanied by regulatory cells with distinct phenotypes. Surprisingly, we observed a dramatic remodeling in the islet microenvironment, in which the resident macrophages underwent a stepwise activation program. This process resulted in polarization of the macrophage subpopulations into a terminal proinflammatory state. This study provides a single-cell atlas defining the staging of autoimmune diabetes and reveals that diabetic autoimmunity is driven by transcriptionally distinct cell populations specialized in divergent biological functions.},

We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

We introduce psupertime, a supervised pseudotime approach which outperforms benchmark pseudotime methods by explicitly using the sequential labels as input. psupertime uses a simple, regression-based model, which by acknowledging the labels assures that genes relevant to the process, rather than to major drivers of variation, are found. psupertime is applicable to the wide range of single cell RNA-seq datasets with sequential labels, derived from either experimental design or user-selected cell cluster sequences, and provides a tool for targeted identification of genes regulated along biological processes.},

We present an approach to characterize communication by ligand-receptor interactions across all cell types in a microenvironment using single-cell RNA sequencing. We apply this approach to identify and compare the ligand-receptor interactions present in six syngeneic mouse tumor models. To identify interactions potentially associated with outcome, we regress interactions against phenotypic measurements of tumor growth rate. In addition, we quantify ligand-receptor interactions between T cell subsets and their relation to immune infiltration using a publicly available human melanoma dataset. Overall, this approach provides a tool for studying cell-cell interactions, their variability across tumors, and their relationship to outcome. Tumors are composed of cancer cells and many non-malignant cell types, such as immune and stromal cells.

In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell–cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol.

Single-cell and whole-islet transcriptomics analyses of immature β cells revealed remarkably diminished expression of β cell autoantigens and MHC class I components, and upregulation of immune inhibitory markers. IRE1α-deficient mice exhibited significantly fewer cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in their pancreata, and adoptive transfer of their total T cells did not induce diabetes in Rag1−/− mice.

	abstract = {Droplet-based scRNA-seq assays are known to produce a significant amount of background RNA counts, the hallmark of which is non-zero transcript counts in presumably empty droplets. The presence of background RNA can lead to systematic biases and batch effects in various downstream analyses such as differential expression and marker gene discovery. In this paper, we explore the phenomenology and mechanisms of background RNA generation in droplet-based scRNA-seq assays and present a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts mirroring those mechanisms. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. We implement the model along with a fast and scalable inference algorithm as the remove-background module in CellBender, an open-source scRNA-seq data processing software package. Finally, we present simulations and investigations of several scRNA-seq datasets to show that processing raw data using CellBender significantly boosts the magnitude and specificity of differential expression across different cell types.},

Using interleukin (IL)-33 receptor knockout mice and in vitro experiments, we show that basophils establish a lung-specific function imprinted by IL-33 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), characterized by unique signaling of cytokines and growth factors important for stromal, epithelial, and myeloid cell fates. Antibody-depletion strategies, diphtheria toxin-mediated selective depletion of basophils, and co-culture studies show that lung resident basophils are important regulators of alveolar macrophage development and function. Together, our study demonstrates how whole-tissue signaling interaction map on the single-cell level can broaden our understanding of cellular networks in health and disease.

Utilizing an integrated strategy based on canonical correlation analysis of 5,265 scRNA-seq profiles, we identified 18 unique cell populations. Combining mass cytometry and transcriptomics revealed cell states expanded in RA synovia: THY1(CD90)+HLA-DRAhi sublining fibroblasts, IL1B+ pro-inflammatory monocytes, ITGAX+TBX21+ autoimmune-associated B cells and PDCD1+ peripheral helper T (TPH) cells and follicular helper T (TFH) cells. We defined distinct subsets of CD8+ T cells characterized by GZMK+, GZMB+, and GNLY+ phenotypes.

	abstract = {Cell fate acquisition is a fundamental developmental process in all multicellular organisms. Yet, much is unknown regarding how a cell traverses the pathway from stem cell to terminal differentiation. Advances in single cell genomics1 hold promise for unraveling developmental mechanisms2-3 in tissues4, organs5-6, and organisms7-8. However, lineage tracing can be challenging for some tissues9 and integration of high-quality datasets is often necessary to detect rare cell populations and developmental states10,11. Here, we harmonized single cell mRNA sequencing data from over 110,000 cells to construct a comprehensive atlas for a stereotypically developing organ with indeterminate growth, the Arabidopsis root. To test the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow . Although both transcription factors are required for early specification of cell identity12, our results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway acting in mature cells to specify endodermal identity, for which SHORTROOT is required. Uncovering the architecture of this pathway will provide insight into specification and stabilization of the endodermis, a tissue analogous to the mammalian epithelium. Thus, the atlas is a pivotal advance for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate organ development in space and time.

Because aging reflects a stochastic process of increasing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difficult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary cells to derive insights into genetic and transcriptional processes that operate on aging human tissue.

In a dual-center, two-cohort study, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to determine changes in immune cell composition and activation in mild vs. severe COVID-19 (242 samples from 109 individuals) over time. HLA-DRhiCD11chi inflammatory monocytes with an interferon-stimulated gene signature were elevated in mild COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was marked by occurrence of neutrophil precursors, as evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DRlo monocytes.

Insulitis activates antigen presenting cells, which trigger activating CD4+ helper-T cells, releasing chemokines/cytokines.

Extrinsic pathway includes Fas pathway to CD4+-CD8+ interaction, whereas intrinsic pathway includes mitochondria-driven pathway at a balance between anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL and pro-apoptotic Bad, Bid, and Bik proteins. Activated cleaved caspse-3 is the converging point between extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. Apoptosis takes place only when pro-apoptotic proteins exceed anti-apoptotic proteins. Since the concordance rate of T1DM in identical twins is about 50\%, environmental factors are involved in the development of T1DM, opening a door to find means to detect and prevent further development of autoimmune β-cell destruction for a therapeutic application.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific bar codes (BCs), and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus, the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapse UMIs, either just for exon mapping reads or for both exon and intron mapping reads. If BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes but also allows the user to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analyzed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35\% of all reads map to introns. Also, we show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution. Conclusions: zUMIs flexibility makes if possible to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast, and user-friendly pipeline to process such scRNA-seq data.},

The majority of these lesions are benign adrenocortical adenomas (80\%), characterized in 10-40\% of the cases by autonomous cortisol hypersecretion, and in 1-10\% by aldosterone hypersecretion. Several observational studies have shown that autonomous cortisol and aldosterone hypersecretion are more prevalent than expected in patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis: these patients have accelerated bone loss and an increased incidence of vertebral fractures. In contrast to glucocorticoid action, the effects of aldosterone on bone are less well understood. Recent data, demonstrating a concomitant co-secretion of glucocorticoid metabolites in patients with primary aldosteronism, could explain some of the metabolic abnormalities seen in patients with aldosterone hypersecretion. In clinical practice, patients with unexplained osteoporosis, particularly when associated with other features such as impaired glucose tolerance or hypertension, should be investigated for the possible presence of autonomous cortisol or aldosterone secretion due to an adrenal adenoma. Randomized intervention studies are needed, however, to investigate the optimum interventions for osteoporosis and other co-morbidities in these patients.},

The nature, extent, and generality of these differences were assessed by comparing the responses to these CSFs, either alone or in combination, in various human and murine macrophage lineage populations. The differences between the respective global gene expression profiles of macrophages, derived from human monocytes by GM-CSF or M-CSF, were compared with the differences between the respective profiles for macrophages, derived from murine bone marrow cells by each CSF. Only 17\% of genes regulated differently by these CSFs were common across the species. Whether a particular change in relative gene expression is by direct action of a CSF can be confounded by endogenous mediators, such as type I IFN, IL-10, and activin A. Time-dependent differences in cytokine gene expression were noted in human monocytes treated with the CSFs; in this system, GM-CSF induced a more dramatic expression of IFN-regulated factor 4 (IRF4) than of IRF5, whereas M-CSF induced IRF5 but not IRF4. In the presence of both CSFs, some evidence of "competition" at the level of gene expression was observed. Care needs to be exercised when drawing definitive conclusions from a particular in vitro system about the roles of GM-CSF and M-CSF in macrophage lineage biology.

We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal.

	abstract = {The adrenal gland is a composite endocrine organ with vital functions that include the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines. To define the molecular landscape that underlies the specific functions of the adrenal gland, we combined a genome-wide transcriptomics approach using messenger RNA sequencing of human tissues with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling on tissue microarrays. Approximately two-thirds of all putative protein coding genes were expressed in the adrenal gland, and the analysis identified 253 genes with an elevated pattern of expression in the adrenal gland, with only 37 genes showing a markedly greater expression level (more than fivefold) in the adrenal gland compared with 31 other normal human tissue types analyzed. The analyses allowed for an assessment of the relative expression levels for well-known proteins involved in adrenal gland function but also identified previously poorly characterized proteins in the adrenal cortex, such as the FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain containing 5 and the nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) protein homolog. We have provided a global analysis of the adrenal gland transcriptome and proteome, with a comprehensive list of genes with elevated expression in the adrenal gland and spatial information with examples of protein expression patterns for corresponding proteins. These genes and proteins constitute im-portant starting points for an improved understanding of the normal function and pathophysiology of the adrenal glands. (Endocrinology 158: 239–251, 2017)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-independent Cushing's syndrome is caused by tumors or hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. The molecular pathogenesis of cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas is not well understood. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing of tumor-tissue specimens from 10 patients with cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas and evaluated recurrent mutations in candidate genes in an additional 171 patients with adrenocortical tumors. We also performed genomewide copy-number analysis in 35 patients with cortisol-secreting bilateral adrenal hyperplasias. We studied the effects of these genetic defects both clinically and in vitro. RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed somatic mutations in PRKACA, which encodes the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A [PKA]), in 8 of 10 adenomas (c.617A→C in 7 and c.595-596insCAC in 1). Overall, PRKACA somatic mutations were identified in 22 of 59 unilateral adenomas (37\%) from patients with overt Cushing's syndrome; these mutations were not detectable in 40 patients with subclinical hypercortisolism or in 82 patients with other adrenal tumors. Among 35 patients with cortisol-producing hyperplasias, 5 (including 2 first-degree relatives) carried a germline copy-number gain (duplication) of the genomic region on chromosome 19 that includes PRKACA. In vitro studies showed impaired inhibition of both PKA catalytic subunit mutants by the PKA regulatory subunit, whereas cells from patients with germline chromosomal gains showed increased protein levels of the PKA catalytic subunit; in both instances, basal PKA activity was increased. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations of the catalytic subunit of PKA were found to be associated with human disease. Germline duplications of this gene resulted in bilateral adrenal hyperplasias, whereas somatic PRKACA mutations resulted in unilateral cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas.

	abstract = {Background: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other. Results: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plate-and droplet-based single-cell platforms. Conclusions: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.},

To address this question, we have developed an in vitro disease-in-a-dish model using iPS cells from T2D patients differentiated into myoblasts (iMyos). We find that T2D iMyos in culture exhibit multiple defects mirroring human disease, including an altered insulin signaling, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and reduced mitochondrial oxidation. More strikingly, global phosphoproteomic analysis reveals a multidimensional network of signaling defects in T2D iMyos going beyond the canonical insulin-signaling cascade, including proteins involved in regulation of Rho GTPases, mRNA splicing and/or processing, vesicular trafficking, gene transcription, and chromatin remodeling. These cell-autonomous defects and the dysregulated network of protein phosphorylation reveal a new dimension in the cellular mechanisms underlying the fundamental defects in T2D.},

Here we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint uses a neural network to simultaneously train labelled and unlabelled data and embed cells from both modalities in a common lower dimensional space, enabling label transfer and joint visualisation in an integrative framework. We demonstrate scJoint consistently provides meaningful joint visualisations and achieves significantly higher label transfer accuracy than existing methods using a complex cell atlas data and a biologically varying multi-modal data. This suggests scJoint is effective in overcoming the heterogeneity in different modalities towards a more comprehensive understanding of cellular phenotypes.},

Comparing the injury responses of regenerative and non-regenerative hearts reveals gene regulatory networks, cellular crosstalk, and secreted factors involved in the regeneration process. SUMMARY The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following injury, whereas the neonatal heart can readily regenerate within a short period after birth. Neonatal heart regeneration is orchestrated by multiple cell types intrinsic to the heart, as well as immune cells that infiltrate the heart after injury. To elucidate the transcriptional responses of the different cellular components of the mouse heart following injury, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on neonatal hearts at various time points following myocardial infarction and couple the results with bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data collected at the same time points. Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for enhancing cardiac function after injury.},

Dysglycemia and type 2 diabetes results when islet β cells fail to maintain appropriate insulin secretion in the face of insulin resistance. To clarify the early transcriptional events leading to β-cell failure in the setting of obesity, we fed male C57BL/6J mice an obesogenic, high-fat diet (60\% kcal from fat) or a control diet (10\% kcal from fat) for one week, and islets from these mice (from four high-fat- and three control-fed mice) were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) analysis. Islet endocrine cell types (α cells, β cells, δ cells, PP cells) and other resident cell types (macrophages, T cells) were annotated by transcript profiles and visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) plots. UMAP analysis revealed distinct cell clusters (11 for β cells, 5 for α cells, 3 for δ cells, PP cells, ductal cells, endothelial cells), emphasizing the heterogeneity of cell populations in the islet. Collectively, the clusters containing the majority of β cells showed the fewest gene expression changes, whereas clusters harboring the minority of β cells showed the most changes. We identified that distinct β-cell clusters downregulate genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and upregulate genes associated with insulin secretion, whereas others upregulate genes that impair insulin secretion, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Moreover, all β-cell clusters negatively regulate genes associated with immune response activation. Glucagon-producing α cells exhibited patterns similar to β cells but, again, in clusters containing the minority of α cells. Our data indicate that an early transcriptional response in islets to an obesogenic diet reflects an attempt by distinct populations of β cells to augment or impair cellular function and/or reduce inflammatory responses as possible harbingers of ensuing insulin resistance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.},

This is a pristine, exploding field that is flooding biologists with a new wave of data, each with its own specificities in terms of complexity and information content. The integrative analysis of genomic data, collected at different molecular layers from diverse cell populations, holds promise to address the full-scale complexity of biological systems. However, the combination of different single-cell genomic signals is computationally challenging, as these data are intrinsically heterogeneous for experimental, technical and biological reasons. Here, we describe the computational methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data, with a focus on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and on the joint analysis of multimodal signals from individual cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Adipose tissues display a remarkable ability to adapt to the dietary status. Here, we have applied single-nucleus RNA-seq to map the plasticity of mouse epididymal white adipose tissue at single-nucleus resolution in response to high-fat-diet-induced obesity. The single-nucleus approach allowed us to recover all major cell types and to reveal distinct transcriptional stages along the entire adipogenic trajectory from preadipocyte commitment to mature adipocytes. We demonstrate the existence of different adipocyte subpopulations and show that obesity leads to disappearance of the lipogenic subpopulation and increased abundance of the stressed lipid-scavenging subpopulation. Moreover, obesity is associated with major changes in the abundance and gene expression of other cell populations, including a dramatic increase in lipid-handling genes in macrophages at the expense of macrophage-specific genes. The data provide a powerful resource for future hypothesis-driven investigations of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue plasticity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels. We performed an in-depth characterization of the spillover properties in mass cytometry, including limitations defined by the linear range of the mass cytometer and the reproducibility of the spillover over time and across machines. We demonstrated the utility of our method in suspension and imaging mass cytometry. To conclude, our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype artifacts. Signal spillover exists in mass cytometry and complicates the development of antibody panels and the interpretation of the data. Here, we characterize this spillover and its effects on the data. Further, we present an approach to estimate and correct for it, which was implemented in a newly developed R package called CATALYST. We show how this method can be used to correct for channel crosstalk in suspension and imaging mass cytometry data throughout the linear range of the instrument.},

Due to its widespread availability and retained tissue morphology, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are often a material of choice for IMC studies. However, antibody performance and signal-to-noise ratio can differ considerably between FFPE tissues as a consequence of variations in tissue processing, including fixation. We investigated the effect of immunodetection-related signal intensity fluctuations on IMC analysis and phenotype identification in a cohort of twelve colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, we explored different normalisation strategies and propose a workflow to normalise IMC data by semi-automated background removal, using publicly available tools. This workflow can be directly applied to previously obtained datasets and considerably improves the quality of IMC data, thereby supporting the analysis and comparison of multiple samples.},

The existence of doublets, which appear to be—but are not—real cells, is a key confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets, which contained experimentally annotated doublets, and 112 realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiencies. Our results show that existing methods exhibited diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects. Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection accuracy, and the cxds method has the highest computational efficiency. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information. We conduct a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. We evaluate the methods’ detection accuracy, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiency, using a comprehensive set of real and synthetic data.

Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) generated three macrophage populations, occupying separate anatomical niches in the lung. Intravascular cell labeling, cell transplantation, and fate-mapping studies established that classical CD14+ blood monocytes derived from HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages. In contrast, non-classical CD16+ blood monocytes preferentially generated macrophages resident in the lung vasculature (pulmonary intravascular macrophages). Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing defined intermediate differentiation stages in human lung macrophage development from blood monocytes. This study identifies distinct developmental pathways from circulating monocytes to lung macrophages and reveals how cellular origin contributes to human macrophage identity, diversity, and localization in vivo.},

The resulting ‘mouse organogenesis cell atlas’ (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window.

Multiple human studies of T2D have shown that targeting islet inflammation has the potential to be an effective therapeutic strategy.

	abstract = {Activation of the innate immune system in obesity is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the notion that increased numbers of macrophages exist in the islets of type 2 diabetes patients and that this may be explained by a dysregulation of islet-derived inflammatory factors. Increased islet-associated immune cells were observed in human type 2 diabetic patients, high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice, the GK rat, and the db/db mouse. When cultured islets were exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu or when islets were isolated from high-fat-fed mice, increased isletderived inflammatory factors were produced and released, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, chemokine KC, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α. The specificity of this response was investigated by direct comparison to nonislet pancreatic tissue and β-cell lines and was not mimicked by the induction of islet cell death. Further, this inflammatory response was found to be biologically functional, as conditioned medium from human islets exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu could induce increased migration of monocytes and neutrophils. This migration was blocked by IL-8 neutralization, and IL-8 was localized to the human pancreatic α-cell. Therefore, islet-derived inflammatory factors are regulated by a type 2 diabetic milieu and may contribute to the macrophage infiltration of pancreatic islets that we observe in type 2 diabetes. © 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.},

	abstract = {Aims: Islet amyloid is a hallmark in type 2 diabetic subjects, but its implication in clinical features and development of islet pathology is still unclear. Methods: From 118 autopsy cases with type 2 diabetes, 26 cases with islet amyloid deposition (DA+) were selected. Twenty diabetic subjects without obvious amyloid deposition (DA-) matched for the age and diabetes duration and 20 non-diabetic subjects (ND) served for comparison. We examined the severity of amyloid deposition and its relationships with population of endocrine cells, expression of cell damage markers or macrophage infiltration. Correlation of clinical profile with islet pathology was also sought on the subset of the investigated patients. Results: β-Cell volume density was nearly 40\% less in DA+ and 20\% less in DA- when compared to ND. Severity of amyloid deposition correlated with reduced volume densities of β-cell and α-cell, and increased body mass index (BMI), but not with duration of diabetes, age or HbA1c. Amyloid-rich islets contained an increased number of macrophages mixed with β-cells with oxidative stress-related DNA damage, characterized by γH2AX expression, and suppressed (pro)insulin mRNA expression. Conclusions: In Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, islet amyloid was more common with severe β-cell loss and high BMI, associated with macrophage infiltration. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

	abstract = {The study of organs and tissues on a molecular level is necessary as we seek an understanding of health and disease. Over the last few years, powerful highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches that rely on the serial imaging of tissues with fluorescently labeled antibodies and the simultaneous analysis using metal-labeled antibodies have emerged. These techniques enable analysis of dozens of epitopes in thousands of cells in a single experiment providing a systems level view of normal and disease processes at the single-cell level with spatial resolution in tissues. In this Review, I discuss, first, the highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches and the generated data. Second, I describe challenges that must be overcome to implement these imaging methods from bench to bedside, including issues with tissue processing and analyses of the large amounts of data generated. Third, I discuss how these methods can be integrated with readouts of genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and live cell information, and fourth, the novel applications possible in tissue biology, drug development, and biomarker discovery. I anticipate that highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches will broadly complement existing imaging methods and will become a cornerstone of tissue biology and biomedical research and of precision medical applications.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities, known as multimodal analysis, represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates new computational methods that can define cellular states based on multiple data types. Here, we introduce ‘weighted-nearest neighbor’ analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.

Following on these findings, we use PCR products from different cell types to identify novel pancreatic genes, some of which mark subtypes of developing pancreatic cells. By integrating these data with previous genetic and biochemical studies, we propose a pathway for pancreatic cell development.

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: It is widely accepted that production of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide in islet cells is specific to beta, alpha, delta and pancreatic polypeptide cells, respectively. We examined whether beta cells express other genes encoding islet hormones. Methods: Nested RT-PCR was performed on single beta cells of transgenic mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by mouse insulin I promoter (MIP-GFP). Results: Only 55\% of adult beta cells expressed the insulin gene alone, while others expressed two or more islet hormone genes; 4\% expressed all four hormone genes. In embryonic and neonatal cells, 60\% to 80\% of GFP+ cells co-expressed pancreatic polypeptide and insulin genes in contrast to 29\% in adult. To clarify cell fate, we conducted lineage tracing using rat insulin II promoter-cre mice crossed with reporter mice Gt(ROSA)26Sor-loxP-flanked STOP-cassette-GFP. All GFP+ cells expressed insulin I and II genes, and showed similar heterogeneity of co-expression to that seen in MIP-GFP mice. Although we report expression of other hormone genes in a significant proportion of beta cells, our lineage tracing results demonstrate that after inducing InsII (also known as Ins2) expression, beta cell progenitors do not redifferentiate to non-beta cells. Conclusions/interpretation: This study shows co-expression of multiple hormone genes in beta cells of adult mice as well as in embryos and neonates. This finding could: (1) represent residual expression from beta cell precursors; (2) result from alternative developmental pathways for beta cells; or (3) denote the differentiation potential of these cells. It may be linked to functional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity in gene expression may provide a means to characterise the functional, cellular and developmental heterogeneity seen in beta cells.},

It can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a variety of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve. Results: We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods. Conclusions: Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories. Accurate lineage inference is a critical step in the identification of dynamic temporal gene expression.},

It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain.

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a chronic age-related disorder characterized by hyperglycemia due to the failure of pancreatic beta cells to compensate for increased insulin demand, typically associated with peripheral insulin resistance. However, despite decades of research, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying T2D remain poorly defined. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) enables multiplexed assessment of the abundance and subcellular localization of multiple proteins on the same tissue section. Herein, we utilized IMC with a panel of 34 antibodies to quantify key markers of pancreatic exocrine, islet, and immune cells as well as stromal components. We employed this panel to analyze over 2.1 million cells from 16 pancreata obtained from donors with T2D and 13 pancreata from age similar non-diabetic controls. In the T2D pancreata, we observed significant alterations in islet architecture, endocrine cell composition, and surprisingly immune cell constituents. Thus, both HLA-DR positive CD8 T cells and macrophages were enriched intra-islet in the T2D pancreas. These efforts demonstrate the utility of IMC to investigate complex events at the cellular level in order to provide new insights into the pathophysiology of T2D.

	abstract = {Genomic alterations shape cell phenotypes and the structure of tumor ecosystems in poorly defined ways. To investigate these relationships, we used imaging mass cytometry to quantify the expression of 37 proteins with subcellular spatial resolution in 483 tumors from the METABRIC cohort. Single-cell analysis revealed cell phenotypes spanning epithelial, stromal and immune types. Distinct combinations of cell phenotypes and cell–cell interactions were associated with genomic subtypes of breast cancer. Epithelial luminal cell phenotypes separated into those predominantly impacted by mutations and those affected by copy number aberrations. Several features of tumor ecosystems, including cellular neighborhoods, were linked to prognosis, illustrating their clinical relevance. In summary, systematic analysis of single-cell phenotypic and spatial correlates of genomic alterations in cancer revealed how genomes shape both the composition and architecture of breast tumor ecosystems and will enable greater understanding of the phenotypic impact of genomic alterations. Bodenmiller and colleagues pair imaging mass cytometry with data from the METABRIC cohort to define single-cell phenotypic and genomic features of breast cancer with spatial context, finding associations with breast cancer subtypes and prognosis.},

A key challenge in the analysis of single-cell multimodal data is to devise appropriate strategies for tying together data across different modalities.

Although existing integration strategies exploit similar mathematical ideas, they typically have distinct goals and rely on different principles and assumptions. Consequently, new definitions and concepts are needed to contextualize existing methods and to enable development of new methods.

Here, we use MULTI-seq to generate scRNA-seq profiles of over 66,000 cells from 36 mice during normal or impaired lung development secondary to hyperoxia with validation of some of the findings in lungs from BPD patients. We observe dynamic populations of cells, including several rare cell types and putative progenitors. Hyperoxia exposure, which mimics the BPD phenotype, alters the composition of all cellular compartments, particularly alveolar epithelium, stromal fibroblasts, capillary endothelium and macrophage populations. Pathway analysis and predicted dynamic cellular crosstalk suggest inflammatory signaling as the main driver of hyperoxia-induced changes.

	abstract = {Word count: abstract 200 words, main text 3599 words. Abstract Loss of mature β cell function and identity, or β cell dedifferentiation, is seen in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Two competing models explain β cell dedifferentiation in diabetes. In the first model, β cells dedifferentiate in the reverse order of their developmental ontogeny. This model predicts that dedifferentiated β cells resemble β cell progenitors. In the second model, β cell dedifferentiation depends on the type of diabetogenic stress. This model, which we call the "Anna Karenina" model, predicts that in each type of diabetes, β cells dedifferentiate in their own way, depending on how their mature identity is disrupted by any particular diabetogenic stress. We directly tested the two models using a β cell-specific lineage-tracing system coupled with RNA-sequencing in mice. We constructed a multidimensional map of β cell transcriptional trajectories during the normal course of β cell postnatal development and during their dedifferentiation in models of both type 1 diabetes (NOD) and type 2 diabetes (BTBR-Lep ob/ob). Using this unbiased approach, we show here that despite some similarities between immature and dedifferentiated β cells, β cells dedifferentiation in the two mouse models is not a reversal of developmental ontogeny and is different between different types of diabetes.},

Results: We demonstrate that contamination from this”soup” of cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating”background-corrected” cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics. Conclusions: We present SoupX, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing experiments.

	abstract = {Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy and increases the risk of the offspring developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life. Alterations in the immune system are implicated in the pathogenesis of IUGR-induced T2DM. The development of the fetal immune system is a delicate balance as it must remain tolerant of maternal antigens whilst also preparing for the post-birth environment. In addition, the fetal immune system is susceptible to an altered intrauterine milieu caused by maternal and placental inflammatory mediators or secondary to nutrient and oxygen deprivation. Pancreatic-resident macrophages populate the pancreas during fetal development, and their phenotype is dynamic through the neonatal period. Furthermore, macrophages in the islets are instrumental in islet development as they influence β-cell proliferation and islet neogenesis. In addition, cytokines, derived from β-cells and macrophages, are important to islet homeostasis in the fetus and adult and, when perturbed, can cause islet dysfunction. Several activated immune pathways have been identified in the islets of people who experienced IUGR, with alternations in the levels of IL-1β and IL-4 as well as changes in TGFβ signalling. Leptin levels are also altered. Immunomodulation has shown therapeutic benefit in T2DM and might be particularly useful in IUGR-induced T2DM.},

In this context, adipose tissue and liver inflammation have been particularly well studied; however, abundant evidence demonstrates that inflammatory processes are also activated in pancreatic islets from obese animals and humans with obesity and/or T2DM. In this Review, we focus on the characteristics of immune cell-mediated inflammation in islets and the consequences of this with respect to β-cell function. In contrast to type 1 diabetes mellitus, the dominant immune cell type causing inflammation in obese and T2DM islets is the macrophage. The increased macrophage accumulation in T2DM islets primarily arises through local proliferation of resident macrophages, which then provide signals (such as platelet-derived growth factor) that drive β-cell hyperplasia (a classic feature of obesity). In addition, islet macrophages also impair the insulin secretory capacity of β-cells. Through these mechanisms, islet-resident macrophages underlie the inflammatory response in obesity and mechanistically participate in the β-cell hyperplasia and dysfunction that characterizes this insulin-resistant state. These findings point to the possibility of therapeutics that target islet inflammation to elicit beneficial effects on β-cell function and glycaemia. The dominant immune cell type causing pancreatic islet inflammation in individuals with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus is the macrophage.

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is characterized by the failure of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells (or β-cell death) due to either autoimmunity (type 1 diabetes mellitus) or failure to compensate for insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes mellitus; T2DM). In addition, mutations of critical genes cause monogenic diabetes. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary site for proinsulin folding; therefore, ER proteostasis is crucial for both β-cell function and survival under physiological and pathophysiological challenges. Importantly, the ER is also the major intracellular Ca2+ storage organelle, generating Ca2+ signals that contribute to insulin secretion. ER stress is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we summarize the mutations in monogenic diabetes that play causal roles in promoting ER stress in β-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for ER proteostasis imbalance with a focus on T2DM, in which both genetics and environment are considered important in promoting ER stress in β-cells. We also suggest that controlled insulin secretion from β-cells might reduce the progression of a key aspect of the metabolic syndrome, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, we evaluate potential therapeutic approaches to treat T2DM, including the optimization and protection of functional β-cell mass in individuals with T2DM. This Review summarizes the mechanisms by which endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to β-cell dysfunction and cell death in monogenic diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Thus, single-cell data have a hierarchical structure that many current single-cell methods do not address, leading to biased inference, highly inflated type 1 error rates, and reduced robustness and reproducibility. This includes methods that use a batch effect correction for individual as a means of accounting for within-sample correlation. Here, we document this dependence across a range of cell types and show that pseudo-bulk aggregation methods are conservative and underpowered relative to mixed models. To compute differential expression within a specific cell type across treatment groups, we propose applying generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for individual, to properly account for both zero inflation and the correlation structure among measures from cells within an individual. Finally, we provide power estimates across a range of experimental conditions to assist researchers in designing appropriately powered studies. Single cell genomics uses cells from the same individual, or pseudoreplicates, that can introduce biases and inflate type I error rates.

Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.

Moreover, all subpopulations were identified in native pancreatic tissue from multiple donors. By Patch-seq, MAFA/MAFB co-expressing β cells showed enhanced electrophysiological activity. Thus, these results indicate combinatorial TF expression in islet α and β cells predicts highly functional, mature subpopulations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (
                http://www.cellchat.org/

Single-cell methods record molecule expressions of cells in a given tissue, but understanding interactions between cells remains challenging. Here the authors show by applying systems biology and machine learning approaches that they can infer and analyze cell-cell communication networks in an easily interpretable way.},

Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences. To exemplify these principles, we exposed true and false discoveries of differentially expressed genes in the injured mouse spinal cord.

	abstract = {It is well recognized that batch effect in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a big challenge when integrating different datasets. Here, we proposed deepMNN, a novel deep learning-based method to correct batch effect in scRNA-seq data. We first searched mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) pairs across different batches in a principal component analysis (PCA) subspace. Subsequently, a batch correction network was constructed by stacking two residual blocks and further applied for the removal of batch effects. The loss function of deepMNN was defined as the sum of a batch loss and a weighted regularization loss. The batch loss was used to compute the distance between cells in MNN pairs in the PCA subspace, while the regularization loss was to make the output of the network similar to the input. The experiment results showed that deepMNN can successfully remove batch effects across datasets with identical cell types, datasets with non-identical cell types, datasets with multiple batches, and large-scale datasets as well. We compared the performance of deepMNN with state-of-the-art batch correction methods, including the widely used methods of Harmony, Scanorama, and Seurat V4 as well as the recently developed deep learning-based methods of MMD-ResNet and scGen. The results demonstrated that deepMNN achieved a better or comparable performance in terms of both qualitative analysis using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots and quantitative metrics such as batch and cell entropies, ARI F1 score, and ASW F1 score under various scenarios. Additionally, deepMNN allowed for integrating scRNA-seq datasets with multiple batches in one step. Furthermore, deepMNN ran much faster than the other methods for large-scale datasets. These characteristics of deepMNN made it have the potential to be a new choice for large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis.},

Results: Here, we present a single-cell Generative Adversarial Network (scGAN) to simultaneously acquire patterns from raw data while minimizing the confounding effect driven by technical artifacts or other factors inherent to the data. Specifically, scGAN models the data likelihood of the raw scRNA-seq counts by projecting each cell onto a latent embedding. Meanwhile, scGAN attempts to minimize the correlation between the latent embeddings and the batch labels across all cells. We demonstrate scGAN on three public scRNA-seq datasets and show that our method confers superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in forming clusters of known cell types and identifying known psychiatric genes that are associated with major depressive disorder.},

Although there are various tools and methods to correct for batch effects, their performance can vary. Therefore, it is important to understand how batch effects manifest to adjust for them. Here, we systematically explore batch effects across various scRNA-seq datasets according to magnitude, cell type specificity, and complexity. We developed a cell-specific mixing score (cms) that quantifies mixing of cells frommultiple batches. By considering distance distributions, the score is able to detect local batch bias aswell as differentiate between unbalanced batches and systematic differences between cells of the same cell type. We compare metrics in scRNA-seq data using real and synthetic datasets and whereas these metrics target the same question and are used interchangeably, we find differences in scalability, sensitivity, and ability to handle differentially abundant cell types. We find that cell-specific metrics outperform cell type-specific and global metrics and recommend them for both method benchmarks and batch exploration.},

Here we employed mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to obtain a comprehensive human immune cells landscape in the context of poor sleep, which was analyzed in the context of subset composition, gene signatures, enriched pathways, transcriptional regulatory networks, and intercellular interactions. Participants subjected to staying up had increased T and plasma cell frequency, along with upregulated autoimmune-related markers and pathways in CD4+ T and B cells. Additionally, staying up reduced the differentiation and immune activity of cytotoxic cells, indicative of a predisposition to infection and tumor development. Finally, staying up influenced myeloid subsets distribution and induced inflammation development and cellular senescence. These findings could potentially give high-dimensional and advanced insights for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pathologic conditions related to poor sleep. Liu et al. use mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of healthy human blood samples to obtain a comprehensive human immune cell landscape when sleep duration is reduced.

	abstract = {Regular physical exercise has long been recognized to reverse the effects of diet-induced obesity, but the molecular mechanisms mediating these multi-tissue beneficial effects remain uncharacterized. Here, we address this challenge by studying the opposing effects of exercise training and high-fat diet at single-cell, deconvolution and tissue-level resolutions across 3 metabolic tissues. We profile scRNA-seq in 204,883 cells, grouped into 53 distinct cell subtypes/states in 22 major cell types, from subcuta-neous and visceral white adipose tissue (WAT), and skeletal muscle (SkM) in mice with diet and exercise training interventions. With a great number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) profiled, we compared depot-specific adipose stem cell (ASC) states, and defined 7 distinct fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP) states in SkM including discovering and validating a novel CD140+/CD34+/SCA1-FAP population. Exercise- and obesity-regulated proportion, transcriptional and cell-cell interaction changes were most strongly pronounced in and centered around ASCs, FAPs, macrophages and T-cells. These changes reflected thermogenesis-vs-lipogenesis and hyperplasia-vs-hypertrophy shifts, clustered in pathways including extracellular matrix remodeling and circadian rhythm, and implicated complex single- and multi-tissue communication including training-associated shift of a cytokine from binding to its decoy receptor on ASCs to true receptor on M2 macrophages in vWAT. Overall, our work provides new insights on the metabolic protective effects of exercise training, uncovers a previously-underappreciated role of MSCs in mediating tissue-specific and multi-tissue effects, and serves as a model for multitissue single-cell analyses in physiologically complex and multifactorial traits exemplified by obesity and exercise training.

	abstract = {Single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) has rapidly gained popularity over the last few years for profiling the transcriptomes of thousands to millions of single cells. To date, there are more than a thousand software packages that have been developed to analyse scRNA-seq data. These focus predominantly on visualization, dimensionality reduction and cell type identification. Single cell technology is now being used to analyse experiments with complex designs including biological replication. One question that can be asked from single cell experiments which has not been possible to address with bulk RNA-seq data is whether the cell type proportions are different between two or more experimental conditions. As well as gene expression changes, the relative depletion or enrichment of a particular cell type can be the functional consequence of disease or treatment. However, cell type proportions estimates from scRNA-seq data are variable and statistical methods that can correctly account for different sources of variability are needed to confidently identify statistically significant shifts in cell type composition between experimental conditions. We present propeller, a robust and flexible method that leverages biological replication to find statistically significant differences in cell type proportions between groups. The propeller method is publicly available in the open source speckle R package (https://github.com/Oshlack/speckle).

Recent technological advances in next-generation sequencing- and imaging-based approaches have established the power of spatial transcriptomics to measure expression levels of all or most genes systematically throughout tissue space, and have been adopted to generate biological insights in neuroscience, development and plant biology as well as to investigate a range of disease contexts, including cancer. Similar to datasets made possible by genomic sequencing and population health surveys, the large-scale atlases generated by this technology lend themselves to exploratory data analysis for hypothesis generation. Here we review spatial transcriptomic technologies and describe the repertoire of operations available for paths of analysis of the resulting data. Spatial transcriptomics can also be deployed for hypothesis testing using experimental designs that compare time points or conditions—including genetic or environmental perturbations. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data are naturally amenable to integration with other data modalities, providing an expandable framework for insight into tissue organization.

Here, by leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 42,156 cells collected from the site of implantation of either polycaprolactone or an extracellular-matrix-derived scaffold in a mouse model of volumetric muscle loss, we report a computational analysis of intercellular signalling networks reconstructed from predictions of transcription-factor activation. We found that intercellular signalling networks can be clustered into modules associated with specific cell subsets, and that biomaterial-specific responses can be characterized by interactions between signalling modules for immune, fibroblast and tissue-specific cells. In a Il17ra–/– mouse model, we validated that predicted interleukin-17-linked transcriptional targets led to concomitant changes in gene expression. Moreover, we identified cell subsets that had not been implicated in the responses to implanted biomaterials. Single-cell atlases of the cellular responses to implanted biomaterials will facilitate the design of implantable biomaterials and the understanding of the ensuing cellular responses. Cellular signalling networks in the microenvironment of implanted biomaterial scaffolds can be computationally reconstructed from single-cell RNA-sequencing data of cells collected from the implantation site.},

	abstract = {The cranial neural crest generates a huge diversity of derivatives, including the bulk of connective and skeletal tissues of the vertebrate head. How neural crest cells acquire such extraordinary lineage potential remains unresolved. By integrating single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of cranial neural crest-derived cells across the zebrafish lifetime, we observe progressive and region-specific establishment of enhancer accessibility for distinct fates. Neural crest-derived cells rapidly diversify into specialized progenitors, including multipotent skeletal progenitors, stromal cells with a regenerative signature, fibroblasts with a unique metabolic signature linked to skeletal integrity, and gill-specific progenitors generating cell types for respiration. By retrogradely mapping the emergence of lineage-specific chromatin accessibility, we identify a wealth of candidate lineage-priming factors, including a Gata3 regulatory circuit for respiratory cell fates. Rather than multilineage potential being established during cranial neural crest specification, our findings support progressive and region-specific chromatin remodeling underlying acquisition of diverse potential. Cranial neural crest generates a wide diversity of cell types. Here the authors perform single-cell profiling of neural crest to identify key enhancers and transcription factors for cell fate competency, thus revealing progressive acquisition of fate potential.},

To decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed β-cell proliferation in isolated rat islets exposed to glucose and oleate or palmitate for 48 h and analyzed the transcriptional response by single-cell RNA sequencing. Unsupervised clustering of pooled β cells identified subpopulations, including proliferating β cells. β-cell proliferation increased in response to oleate but not palmitate. Both fatty acids enhanced the expression of genes involved energy metabolism and mitochondrial activity. Comparison of proliferating vs. non-proliferating β cells and pseudotime ordering suggested the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxiredoxin signaling. Accordingly, the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine and the peroxiredoxin inhibitor Conoidin A both blocked oleate-induced β-cell proliferation. Our data reveal a key role for ROS signaling in β-cell proliferation in response to nutrients.},

	abstract = {The cellular identity of pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy)-expressing γ-cells, one of the rarest pancreatic islet cell-type, remains elusive. Within islets, glucagon and somatostatin, released respectively from α- and δ-cells, modulate the secretion of insulin by β-cells. Dysregulation of insulin production raises blood glucose levels, leading to diabetes onset. Here, we present the genetic signature of human and mouse γ-cells. Using different approaches, we identified a set of genes and pathways defining their functional identity. We found that the γ-cell population is heterogeneous, with subsets of cells producing another hormone in addition to Ppy. These bihormonal cells share identity markers typical of the other islet cell-types. In mice, Ppy gene inactivation or conditional γ-cell ablation did not alter glycemia nor body weight. Interestingly, upon β-cell injury induction, γ-cells exhibited gene expression changes and some of them engaged insulin production, like α- and δ-cells. In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive characterization of γ-cells and highlight their plasticity and therapeutic potential. The cellular identity and function of the pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy)-producing γ-cells are incompletely understood. Here the authors show that these cells are heterogeneous and display adaptive plasticity to engage in insulin production following β-cell injury, but loss of the Ppy gene or γ-cells in mice does not affect weight or glycemia under basal conditions.},

Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of {\textgreater}50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease. Immune cells are shaped by the tissue environment, yet the states of healthy human T cells are mainly studied in the blood. Here, the authors perform single cell RNA-seq of T cells from tissues and blood of healthy donors and show its utility as a reference map for comparison of human T cell states in disease.},

We have generated dense single-cell and spatial reference maps of the human uterus and three-dimensional endometrial organoid cultures.

Our benchmark of the endometrial organoids reveals the pathways and cell states regulating differentiation of the secretory and ciliated lineages both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro downregulation of WNT or NOTCH pathways increases the differentiation efficiency along the secretory and ciliated lineages, respectively. We utilize our cellular maps to deconvolute bulk data from endometrial cancers and endometriotic lesions, illuminating the cell types dominating in each of these disorders. These mechanistic insights provide a platform for future development of treatments for common conditions including endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic profiling of the human endometrium highlights pathways governing the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle.

Both β-cell maturation and functional adaptation rely on the interplay between extracellular cues and cell type-specific transcriptional programs. Here we review emerging evidence that developmental and homeostatic regulation of β-cell function involves collaboration between lineage-determining and signal-dependent transcription factors (LDTFs and SDTFs, respectively). A deeper understanding of β-cell SDTFs and their cognate signals would delineate mechanisms of β-cell maturation and functional adaptation, which has direct implications for diabetes therapies and for generating mature β-cells from stem cells.},

	abstract = {The lack of understanding as to the cellular and molecular basis of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) has hindered the search for new effective therapies and biomarkers. Here, to address this gap, we analysed 740,000 single nuclei RNAseq profiles of 165 samples of white matter (WM) lesions, normal appearing WM, grey matter (GM) lesions and normal appearing GM from 55 MS patients and 28 controls. We find that gene expression changes in response to MS are highly cell-type specific in WM and GM lesions but are largely shared within an individual cell-type across lesions, following a continuum rather than discrete lesion-specific molecular programs. The major biological determinants of variability in gene expression in MS samples relate to individual patient effects, rather than to lesion types or other metadata. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+), we identify three subgroups of MS patients with distinct oligodendrocyte composition and WM glial gene expression signatures, suggestive of engagement of different pathological/regenerative processes. The discovery of these three patterns significantly advances our mechanistic understanding of progressive MS, provides a framework to use molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for best therapeutic approaches for progressive MS, and highlights the need for precision-medicine approaches to address heterogeneity among MS patients.

Reference datasets, however, are predominantly constructed from single-cell RNA-seq data, and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce ‘bridge integration’, a method to harmonize singlecell datasets across modalities by leveraging a multi-omic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multi-omic dataset comprises an element in a ‘dictionary’, which can be used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. We demonstrate that our procedure can accurately harmonize transcriptomic data with independent single cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to substantially improve computational scalability, and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach aims to broaden the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitate comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.

We set out to contextualize macrophage heterogeneity across mouse tissues and inflammatory conditions, specifically aiming to define a common framework of macrophage activation. We built a predictive model with which we mapped the activation of macrophages across 12 tissues and 25 biological conditions, finding a notable commonality and finite number of transcriptional profiles, in particular among infiltrating macrophages, which we modeled as defined stages along four conserved activation paths. These activation paths include a “phagocytic” regulatory path, an “inflammatory” cytokine-producing path, an “oxidative stress” antimicrobial path, or a “remodeling” extracellular matrix deposition path. We verified this model with adoptive cell transfer experiments and identified transient RELMɑ expression as a feature of monocyte-derived macrophage tissue engraftment.

These genesets define islet cellular identities better than previously published genesets. We show their efficacy to outline cell identity changes and unravel some of their underlying genetic mechanisms, whether during embryonic pancreas development or in experimental setups aiming at developing glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells, such as pluripotent stem-cell differentiation or in adult islet cell reprogramming protocols. These islet cell type-specific genesets represent valuable tools that accurately benchmark gain and loss in islet cell identity traits. Cell therapy to replace β-cells is a potential therapeutic avenue to treat diabetes, but the production of insulin-secreting replacement cells requires reliable tools to assess islet cellular identity. Here the authors use single-cell transcriptomics meta-analysis to construct gene sets that describe the identity of human α-, β-, γ- and δ-cells.},

Understanding the mechanisms behind β-cell failure is critical to prevent or revert disease. Basic pathogenic differences exist in the two forms of diabetes mellitus; T1DM is immune mediated and T2DM is mediated by metabolic mechanisms. These mechanisms differentially affect early β-cell dysfunction and eventual fate. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the field, mostly delivered by studies on β-cells in human disease. These advances include studies of islet morphology and human β-cell gene expression in T1DM and T2DM, the identification and characterization of the role of T1DM and T2DM candidate genes at the β-cell level and the endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling that contributes to β-cell failure in T1DM (mostly IRE1 driven) and T2DM (mostly PERK–eIF2α dependent).

	abstract = {Objective: The effectiveness of bariatric surgery in restoring β-cell function has been described in type-2 diabetes (T2D) patients and animal models for years, whereas the mechanistic underpinnings are largely unknown. The possibility of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to rescue far-progressed, clinically-relevant T2D and to promote β-cell recovery has not been investigated on a single-cell level. Nevertheless, characterization of the heterogeneity and functional states of β-cells after VSG is a fundamental step to understand mechanisms of glycaemic recovery and to ultimately develop alternative, less-invasive therapies. Methods: We performed VSG in late-stage diabetic db/db mice and analyzed the islet transcriptome using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Immunohistochemical analyses and quantification of β-cell area and proliferation complement our findings from scRNA-seq. Results: We report that VSG was superior to calorie restriction in late-stage T2D and rapidly restored normoglycaemia in morbidly obese and overt diabetic db/db mice. Single-cell profiling of islets of Langerhans showed that VSG induced distinct, intrinsic changes in the β-cell transcriptome, but not in that of α-, δ-, and PP-cells. VSG triggered fast β-cell redifferentiation and functional improvement within only two weeks of intervention, which is not seen upon calorie restriction. Furthermore, VSG expanded β-cell area by means of redifferentiation and by creating a proliferation competent β-cell state. Conclusion: Collectively, our study reveals the superiority of VSG in the remission of far-progressed T2D and presents paths of β-cell regeneration and molecular pathways underlying the glycaemic benefits of VSG.},

	abstract = {RNA velocity analysis of single cells promises to predict temporal dynamics from gene expression. Indeed, in many systems, it has been observed that RNA velocity produces a vector field which qualitatively reflects known features of the system. Despite this observation, the limitations of RNA velocity estimates are poorly understood. Using real data and simulations, we dissect the impact of different steps in the RNA velocity workflow on the estimated vector field. We find that the process of mapping RNA velocity estimates into a low-dimensional representation, such as those produced by UMAP, has a large impact on the result. The RNA velocity vector field is strongly dependent on the k-NN graph of the data. This dependence lead to large estimator errors when the k-NN graph is not a faithful representation of the true data structure; a feature which cannot be known for most real datasets. Finally, we establish that RNA velocity does not estimate expression speed neither at the gene nor at the cellular level. We propose that RNA velocity is best considered a smoothed interpolation of the observed k-NN structure, as opposed to an extrapolation of future cellular states, and that the use of RNA velocity as a validation of latent space embedding structures is circular.

We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space.

The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1–8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.

We identify previously underappreciated cellular heterogeneity of the developing mesenchyme and reconstruct potential lineage relationships among the pancreatic mesothelium and mesenchymal cell types. Within the epithelium, we find a previously undescribed endocrine progenitor population, as well as an analogous population in both human fetal tissue and human embryonic stem cells differentiating toward a pancreatic beta cell fate. Further, we identify candidate transcriptional regulators along the differentiation trajectory of this population toward the alpha or beta cell lineages. This work establishes a roadmap of pancreatic development and demonstrates the broad utility of this approach for understanding lineage dynamics in developing organs.

	abstract = {Technological developments have led to an explosion of high-throughput single cell data, which are revealing unprecedented perspectives on cell identity. Recently, significant attention has focused on investigating, from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, cellular dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell (de)activation. Trajectory inference methods estimate a trajectory, a collection of differentiation paths of a dynamic system, by ordering cells along the paths of such a dynamic process. While trajectory inference tools typically work with gene expression levels, common scRNA-seq protocols allow the identification and quantification of unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature spliced mRNAs, for each gene. By exploiting the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA, one can infer the RNA velocity of individual cells, i.e., the time derivative of the gene expression state of cells. Whereas traditional trajectory inference methods reconstruct cellular dynamics given a population of cells of varying maturity, RNA velocity relies on a dynamical model describing splicing dynamics. Here, we initially discuss conceptual and theoretical aspects of both approaches, then illustrate how they can be combined together, and finally present an example use-case on real data.

To study mechanisms of β-cell loss in T2D, we performed islet single-cell RNA-sequencing of two obese mouse strains differing in their diabetes susceptibility. On a control diet, we identified six β-cell clusters with similar abundance in both strains. However, after feeding a diabetogenic diet for two days, β-cell cluster composition markedly differed between strains. Islets of diabetes-resistant mice developed into a protective β-cell cluster (Beta4), whereas those of diabetes-prone mice progressed towards stress-related clusters with a strikingly different expression pattern. Interestingly, the protective cluster showed indications of reduced β-cell identity, such as downregulation of GLUT2, GLP1R and MafA, and in-vitro knockdown of GLUT2 in β-cells to mimick its phenotype decreased stress response and apoptosis. This might explain enhanced β-cell survival of diabetes-resistant islets. In contrast, β-cells of diabetes-prone mice responded with expression changes indicating metabolic pressure and ER stress, presumably leading to later β-cell loss. In conclusion, failure of diabetes-prone mice to adapt gene expression towards a more dedifferentiated state in response to rising blood glucose levels leads to β-cell failure and diabetes development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We identify a core set of temporally patterned genes and gene regulatory networks that may contribute to the diversification of SGNs through sequential binary decisions and demonstrate a role for NEUROD1 in driving specification of a Ic-SGN phenotype. We also find that each trajectory of the decision tree is defined by initial co-expression of alternative subtype molecular controls followed by gradual shifts toward cell fate resolution. Finally, analysis of both developing SGN and HC types reveals cell-cell signaling potentially playing a role in the differentiation of SGNs. Our results indicate that SGN identities are drafted prior to birth and reveal molecular principles that shape their differentiation and will facilitate studies of their development, physiology, and dysfunction. This study chronicles dynamic gene expression in differentiating spiral ganglion neurons from murine embryonic day 14.5 to postnatal stage, establishes their lineage trajectories, and identifies molecular determinants of cell fate decision.},

Here, we present a 52,698-cell catalog of the TME transcriptome in human lung tumors at single-cell resolution, validated in independent samples where 40,250 additional cells were sequenced. By comparing with matching non-malignant lung samples, we reveal a highly complex TME that profoundly molds stromal cells. We identify 52 stromal cell subtypes, including novel subpopulations in cell types hitherto considered to be homogeneous, as well as transcription factors underlying their heterogeneity. For instance, we discover fibroblasts expressing different collagen sets, endothelial cells downregulating immune cell homing and genes coregulated with established immune checkpoint transcripts and correlating with T-cell activity. By assessing marker genes for these cell subtypes in bulk RNA-sequencing data from 1,572 patients, we illustrate how these correlate with survival, while immunohistochemistry for selected markers validates them as separate cellular entities in an independent series of lung tumors. Hence, in providing a comprehensive catalog of stromal cells types and by characterizing their phenotype and co-optive behavior, this resource provides deeper insights into lung cancer biology that will be helpful in advancing lung cancer diagnosis and therapy. A comprehensive single-cell analysis of the lung cancer microenvironment reveals marked heterogeneity of transcriptional networks that defines novel clinically relevant stromal cell populations.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments.

How islet inflammation contributes to β cell loss remains uncertain. We have reported previously that chronic overnutrition-induced ER stress in β cells causes Ripk3-mediated islet inflammation, macrophage recruitment, and a reduction of β cell numbers in a zebrafish model. We show here that β cell loss results from the intricate communications among β cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Macrophage-derived Tnfa induces \textit{cxcl8a} in β cells. Cxcl8a, in turn, attracts neutrophils to macrophage-contacted "hotspots" where β cell loss occurs. We also show potentiation of chemokine expression in stressed mammalian β cells by macrophage-derived TNFA. In Akita and db/db mice, there is an increase in CXCL15-positive β cells and intra-islet neutrophils. Blocking neutrophil recruitment in Akita mice preserves β cell mass and slows diabetes progression.

Here, we present CellRank (https://cellrank.org) for single-cell fate mapping in diverse scenarios, including regeneration, reprogramming and disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

Cross-species integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data has been a key approach to comparing cell types between species. To robustly identify homologous cell types and species-specific cell populations, it is crucial to obtain reliable and informative integration. However, currently there are neither benchmarks nor guidelines on how to choose among a diversity of integration strategies. To examine the output characteristics of different cross-species integration strategies, we benchmarked 25 combinations of gene homology mapping methods and integration algorithms in a variety of biological settings. We examine each strategy’s capability to perform species-mixing of known homologous cell types and preserve biological heterogeneity using 10 metrics, among which we developed a new biology conservation metric to address the maintenance of cell type distinguishability. Overall, scVI, SeuratV4 methods and SAMap achieve a balance between species-mixing and biology conservation. For evolutionarily distant species, including in-paralogs and using nearest-neighbour based methods is beneficial. SAMap outperforms when integrating whole-body atlases and can prioritize identity-defining similarities between homologous cell types in complex circumstances. We provide our freely available cross-species integration and assessment pipeline to help identify the optimum strategy to analyse new data and develop new algorithms.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is driven by the interplay of pro- and anti-inflammatory leukocytes in the aorta. Yet, the phenotypic and transcriptional diversity of aortic leukocytes is only poorly understood.

Objective
We characterized leukocytes from healthy and atherosclerotic mouse aortas in-depth by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) to define an atlas of the immune cell landscape in atherosclerosis.

Methods and Results
Employing scRNAseq of aortic leukocytes from chow (CD) and western diet (WD) fed Apoe−/− and Ldlr−/− mice, we detected 11 principal leukocyte clusters with distinct phenotypical and spatial characteristics, while the cellular repertoire in healthy aortas was less diverse. Gene set enrichment analysis on a single cell level established that multiple pathways, such as for lipid metabolism, proliferation, and cytokine secretion, were confined to particular leukocyte clusters. Leukocyte populations were differentially regulated in atherosclerotic Apoe−/− and Ldlr−/− mice. We confirmed the phenotypic diversity of these clusters with a novel CyTOF 35-marker panel with metal-labelled antibodies and conventional flow cytometry. Cell populations retrieved by these protein-based approaches were highly correlated to transcriptionally defined clusters. In an integrated screening strategy of scRNAseq, CyTOF, and FACS, we detected three principal B-cell subsets with alterations in surface markers, functional pathways, and in vitro cytokine secretion. Finally, we used leukocyte cluster gene signatures to enumerate leukocyte frequencies in 126 human plaques by a genetic deconvolution strategy. This approach revealed that human carotid plaques and microdissected mouse plaques were mostly populated by macrophages, T-cells, and monocytes. In addition, the frequency of genetically defined leukocyte populations in carotid plaques predicted cardiovascular events in patients.

Conclusion
The definition of leukocyte diversity by high-dimensional analyses enables a fine-grained analysis of aortic leukocyte subsets, reveals new immunological mechanisms and cell-type specific pathways, and establishes a functional relevance for lesional leukocytes in human atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {Objective
Pancreatic islets of Langerhans secrete hormones to regulate systemic glucose levels. Emerging evidence suggests that islet cells are functionally heterogeneous to allow a fine-tuned and efficient endocrine response to physiological changes. A precise description of the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, in particular linking animal models to human islets, is an important step towards identifying the factors critical for endocrine cell function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
Methods
In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 50′000 endocrine cells isolated from healthy human, pig and mouse pancreatic islets and characterize transcriptional heterogeneity and evolutionary conservation of those cells across the three species. We systematically delineated endocrine cell types and α- and β-cell heterogeneity through prior knowledge- and data-driven gene sets shared across species, which altogether capture common and differential cellular properties, transcriptional dynamics and putative driving factors of state transitions.
Results
We showed that global endocrine expression profiles correlate, and that critical identity and functional markers are shared between species, while only approximately 20\% of cell type enriched expression is conserved. We resolved distinct human α- and β-cell states that form continuous transcriptional landscapes. These states differentially activate maturation and hormone secretion programs, which are related to regulatory hormone receptor expression, signaling pathways and different types of cellular stress responses. Finally, we mapped mouse and pig cells to the human reference and observed that the spectrum of human α- and β-cell heterogeneity and aspects of such functional gene expression are better recapitulated in the pig than mouse data.
Conclusions
Here, we provide a high-resolution transcriptional map of healthy human islet cells and their murine and porcine counterparts, which is easily queryable via an online interface. This comprehensive resource informs future efforts that focus on pancreatic endocrine function, failure and regeneration, and enables to assess molecular conservation in islet biology across species for translational purposes.},

We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress.

Among the different model organisms that are currently used to elucidate the basic pathways of pancreas development and regeneration, the zebrafish is distinguished by its unique opportunities to combine genetic and pharmacological approaches with sophisticated live-imaging methodology, and by its ability to regenerate the pancreas within a short time.

However, despite the time and resources invested into the past scRNA-seq studies, there is still no consensus on islet cell states and associated pathways in health and dysfunction as well as the value of frequently used preclinical mouse diabetes models. Since these challenges can be only resolved with a joint analysis of multiple datasets, we present a scRNA-seq cross-condition mouse islet atlas (MIA). We integrated over 300,000 cells from nine datasets with 56 samples, varying in age, sex, and diabetes models, including autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) model (NOD), gluco-/lipotoxicity T2D model (db/db), and chemical streptozotocin (STZ) β-cell ablation model. MIA is a curated resource that enables interactive exploration of gene expression and transfer of cell types and states. We use MIA to obtain new insights into islet cells in health and disease that cannot be reached from individual datasets. Based on the MIA β-cell landscape we report cross-publication differences between previously suggested marker genes of individual phenotypes. We further show that in the STZ model β-cells transcriptionally correlate to human T2D and mouse db/db model β-cells, but are less similar to human T1D and mouse NOD model β-cells. We define new cell states involved in disease progression across diabetes models. We also observe different pathways shared between immature, aged, and diabetes model β-cell states. In conclusion, our work presents the first comprehensive analysis of β-cell responses to different stressors, providing a roadmap for the understanding of β-cell plasticity, compensation, and demise.},

Both types of secretion are activated by a rise in intracellular calcium but how the stimulus-secretion cascade actually regulates secretory output is not well understood. It has long been known that the calcium response of acinar cells to physiological stimulation is complex. Dependent on the type and concentration of agonist, it consists of either local or global calcium increases as well as spreading waves of calcium across the cell. In the past it has been speculated that these different calcium signals drive different secretory responses. Now, recent employment of two-photon microscopy has enabled the simultaneous recording of both enzyme secretion and calcium signals and is beginning to resolve this issue. The data shows that local calcium responses exclusively drive fluid secretion. Where-as, global calcium responses drive both fluid and enzyme secretion. This differential control of secretory output is likely central to controlling the physiological responses of pancreatic acinar cells.},

In response to increased secretory demand, β cells can compensate by increasing insulin production capability even in the face of protracted peripheral insulin resistance. The ability to amplify insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia is a critical facet of β-cell function, and the exact mechanisms by which this occurs have been studied for decades. To adapt to the constant and fast-changing demands for insulin production, β cells use the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum. Failure of these compensatory mechanisms contributes to both type 1 and 2 diabetes. Additionally, studies in which β cells are “rested” by reducing endogenous insulin demand have shown promise as a therapeutic strategy that could be applied more broadly. Here, we review recent findings in β cells pertaining to the metabolic amplifying pathway, the unfolded protein response, and potential advances in therapeutics based on β-cell rest.},

However, evidence suggests that dysfunction and/or death of insulin-producing β-cells is common to virtually all forms of diabetes. Although the mechanisms underlying β-cell dysfunction remain incompletely characterized, recent years have witnessed major advances in our understanding of the molecular pathways that contribute to the demise of the β-cell. Cellular and environmental factors contribute to β-cell dysfunction/loss through the activation of molecular pathways that exacerbate endoplasmic reticulum stress, the integrated stress response, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy. Whereas many of these stress responsive pathways are interconnected, their individual contributions to glucose homeostasis and β-cell health have been elucidated through the development and interrogation of animal models. In these studies, genetic models and pharmacological compounds have enabled the identification of genes and proteins specifically involved in β-cell dysfunction during diabetes pathogenesis.

	abstract = {The increase in the prevalence of obesity represents a worldwide phenomenon in all age groups and is pathologically and genetically correlated with several metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, representing the most frequent age-related diseases. Obesity superimposed on aging drastically increases chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), which is an important link between obesity, insulin resistance, and age-associated diseases. Immune cells of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems infiltrate the adipose tissue (AT) and during obesity induce inflammatory responses associated with metabolic switches and changes in phenotypes and function of immune cell subsets. Obesity poses new health problems especially when it occurs in the context of other diseases, many of them frequently affect elderly subjects. An emerging problem is the decreased proportion of patients with obesity achieving clinical response to therapy. In this review, we will discuss the reciprocal influences of immune cell and AT inflammation in aging and age-associated diseases and the complex relationship of nutrient and energy-sensing homeostatic checkpoints, which contribute to shape the phenotype of the AT. We will specifically examine type-2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cognitive impairment, and dementia, where obesity plays a significant role, also in shaping some clinical aspects.},

Here we show that interleukin (IL)-33 was produced by islet mesenchymal cells and enhanced by a diabetes milieu (glucose, IL-1β, and palmitate). IL-33 promoted β cell function through islet-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that elicited retinoic acid (RA)-producing capacities in macrophages and dendritic cells via the secretion of IL-13 and colony-stimulating factor 2. In turn, local RA signaled to the β cells to increase insulin secretion. This IL-33-ILC2 axis was activated after acute β cell stress but was defective during chronic obesity. Accordingly, IL-33 injections rescued islet function in obese mice. Our findings provide evidence that an immunometabolic crosstalk between islet-derived IL-33, ILC2s, and myeloid cells fosters insulin secretion.},

The data distinguish macrophages within distinct intrapancreatic microenvironments and suggest how macrophage phenotype is imprinted by the local milieu.

In islets, macrophages are the only myeloid cells: they derive from definitive hematopoiesis, exchange to a minimum with blood cells, have a low level of self-replication, and depend on CSF-1. They express Il1b and Tnfa transcripts, indicating classical activation, M1, under steady state. The interacinar stroma contains two macrophage subsets. One is derived from primitive hematopoiesis, with no interchange by blood cells and alternative, M2, activation profile, whereas the second is derived from definitive hematopoiesis and exchanges with circulating myeloid cells but also shows an alternative activation profile. Complete replacement of islet and stromal macrophages by donor stem cells occurred after lethal irradiation with identical profiles as observed under steady state. The extraordinary plasticity of macrophages within the pancreatic organ and the distinct features imprinted by their anatomical localization sets the base for examining these cells in pathological conditions.},

	abstract = {In the developing embryo, appropriate patterning of the endoderm fated to become pancreas requires the spatial and temporal coordination of soluble factors secreted by the surrounding tissues. Once pancreatic progenitor cells are specified in the developing gut tube epithelium, epithelial–mesenchymal interactions, as well as a cascade of transcription factors, subsequently delineate three distinct lineages, including endocrine, exocrine, and ductal cells. Simultaneous morphological changes, including branching, vascularization, and proximal organ development, also influence the process of specification and differentiation. Decades of research using mouse genetics have uncovered many of the key factors involved in pancreatic cell fate decisions. When pancreas development or islet cell functions go awry, due to mutations in genes important for proper organogenesis and development, the result can lead to a common pancreatic affliction, diabetes mellitus. Current treatments for diabetes are adequate but not curative. Therefore, researchers are utilizing the current understanding of normal embryonic pancreas development in vivo, to direct embryonic stem cells toward a pancreatic fate with the goal of transplanting these in vitro generated ‘islets’ into patients. Mimicking development in vitro has proven difficult; however, significant progress has been made and the current differentiation protocols are becoming more efficient. The continued partnership between developmental biologists and stem cell researchers will guarantee that the in vitro generation of insulin-producing β cells is a possible therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.

            Heterotopic ossification (HO) is an aberrant regenerative process with ectopic bone induction in response to musculoskeletal trauma, in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) differentiate into osteochondrogenic cells instead of myocytes or tenocytes. Despite frequent cases of hospitalized musculoskeletal trauma, the inflammatory responses and cell population dynamics that regulate subsequent wound healing and tissue regeneration are still unclear. Here we examine, using a mouse model of trauma-induced HO, the local microenvironment of the initial post-injury inflammatory response. Single cell transcriptome analyses identify distinct monocyte/macrophage populations at the injury site, with their dynamic changes over time elucidated using trajectory analyses. Mechanistically, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1)-producing monocytes/macrophages are associated with HO and aberrant chondrogenic progenitor cell differentiation, while CD47-activating peptides that reduce systemic macrophage TGFβ levels and help ameliorate HO. Our data thus implicate CD47 activation as a therapeutic approach for modulating monocyte/macrophage phenotypes, MSC differentiation and HO formation during wound healing.},

The most widely used insulin-secreting cell lines are RIN, HIT, MIN, INS-1 and βTC cells. These cells produce insulin and small amounts of glucagon and somatostatin. Some of them are only poorly responsive to glucose, others respond to glucose well, but their concentration-dependence curve is markedly shifted to higher sensitivity.

	abstract = {Aging manifests as progressive dysfunction culminating in death. The diversity of cell types is a challenge to the precise quantification of aging and its reversal. Here we develop a suite of ‘aging clocks’ based on single cell transcriptomic data to characterize cell type-specific aging and rejuvenation strategies. The subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic region contains many cell types and provides an excellent system to study cell-level tissue aging and regeneration. We generated 21,458 single-cell transcriptomes from the neurogenic regions of 28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. With these data, we trained a suite of single cell-based regression models (aging clocks) to predict both chronological age (passage of time) and biological age (fitness, in this case the proliferative capacity of the neurogenic region). Both types of clocks perform well on independent cohorts of mice. Genes underlying the single cell-based aging clocks are mostly cell-type specific, but also include a few shared genes in the interferon and lipid metabolism pathways. We used these single cell-based aging clocks to measure transcriptomic rejuvenation, by generating single cell RNA-seq datasets of SVZ neurogenic regions for two interventions –heterochronic parabiosis (young blood) and exercise. Interestingly, the use of aging clocks reveals that both heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic aging in the niche, but in different ways across cell types and genes. This study represents the first development of high-resolution aging clocks from single cell transcriptomic data and demonstrates their application to quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation.},

New technologies, such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), are enabling characterization of the biomaterial response to an unprecedented level of detail, facilitating new discoveries in the complex cellular environment surrounding materials. We performed scRNAseq and integrated data sets from multiple experiments to create a single cell atlas of the biomaterials response that contains 42,156 cells from biological extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived and synthetic polyester (polycaprolactone, PCL) scaffold biomaterials implanted in murine muscle wounds. We identified 18 clusters of cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, multiple subsets of fibroblasts, and myeloid cells, many of which were previously unknown in the biomaterial response. To determine intra and intercellular signaling occurring between the numerous cell subsets, including immune-stromal interactions in the biomaterial response, we developed Domino (github.com/chris-cherry/domino), a computational tool which allows for identification of condition specific intercellular signaling patterns connected to transcription factor activation from single cell data. The Domino networks self-assembled into signaling modules and cellular subsets involved in signaling independent of clustering, defining interactions between immune, fibroblast, and tissue-specific modules with biomaterials-specific communication patterns. Further compilation and integration of biomaterials single cell data sets will delineate the impact of materials chemical and physical properties and biological factors, such as anatomical placement, age, or systemic disease, that will direct biomaterials design.},

	abstract = {Endocrine cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans are heterogeneous in terms of transcriptional profile, protein expression and the regulation of hormone release. Even though this heterogeneity has long been appreciated, only within the past 5 years have detailed molecular analyses led to an improved understanding of its basis. Although we are beginning to recognize why some subpopulations of endocrine cells are phenotypically different to others, arguably the most important consideration is how this heterogeneity affects the regulation of hormone release to control the homeostasis of glucose and other energy-r ich nutrients. The focus of this Review is the description of how endocrine cell heterogeneity (and principally that of insulin-secreting β-c ells) affects the regulation of hormone secretion within the islets of Langerhans. This discussion includes an overview of the functional characteristics of the different islet cell subpopulations and describes how they can communicate to influence islet function under basal and glucose-s timulated conditions. We further discuss how changes to the specific islet cell subpopulations or their numbers might underlie islet dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conclude with a discussion of several key open questions regarding the physiological role of islet cell heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {This ultrastructural analysis of pancreas development under in vivo and in vitro conditions complements earlier biochemical studies. The endocrine and exocrine tissue develops similarly in vitro. The early pancreatic epithelial cells, like those of the gut, form a single layer of cells facing the lumen, and are linked together by junctional complexes. This cellular polarization implies a constraint for the axis of division of exocrine cells, and demands that the endocrine cells loose their connection with the exocrine cells in order to form islets. The presence of mitotic figures in well differentiated acinar cells suggests that cell multiplication is not incompatible with cell differentiation. The first zymogen granules that can be observed look similar to the granules present later in development. This observation suggests that the “prozymogen granules” which were reported in earlier papers were probably the result of fixation artifacts, and did not represent a stage in granule formation between the condensing vacuoles in the Golgi and the definitive zymogen granules. The morphological observations of this study are consistent with the previously proposed biphasic model of differentiation for the exocrine and endocrine B cells. The development of specific organelles correlates with the pattern of accumulation of the specific exocrine proteins and insulin. On the other hand, differentiated A cells are present when the pancreatic bud first forms. This early appearance of differentiated A cells suggests a regulatory role for this hormone in early development.},

In addition, we find that cells expressing Pdx1 give rise to all three types of pancreatic tissue: exocrine, endocrine and duct.

By contrast, the pancreatic duct arises from PDX1+ progenitors that are set aside around embryonic day 10.5 (E9.5-E11.5).

Because transient expression of Neurogenin3 (Neurog3) in progenitor cells in the developing pancreas initiates their differentiation to mature islet cells, we examined the role of Neurog3 in cell cycle control during this process. We found that mitotically active pancreatic progenitor cells in mouse embryos exited the cell cycle after the initiation of Neurog3 expression. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the Neurog3-expressing cells dramatically up-regulated the mRNA encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (Cdkn1a). In Neurog3 null mice, the islet progenitor cells failed to activate Cdkn1a expression and continued to proliferate, showing that their exit from the cell cycle requires Neurog3. Furthermore, induced transgenic expression of Neurog3 in mouse β-cells in vivo markedly decreased their proliferation, increased Cdkn1a levels, and eventually caused profound hyperglycemia. In contrast, in Cdkn1a null mice, proliferation was incompletely suppressed in the Neurog3-expressing cells. These studies reveal a crucial role for Neurog3 in regulating the cell cycle during the differentiation of islet cells and demonstrate that the subsequent down-regulation of Neurog3 allows the mature islet cell population to expand.},

They subsequently delaminate out of the epithelium and cluster in the mesenchyme to form the islets of Langerhans. Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) is a transcription factor required for the differentiation of all endocrine cells and we investigated its role in their delamination. We observed in the mouse pancreas that most Ngn3-positive cells have lost contact with the lumen of the epithelium, showing that the delamination from the progenitor layer is initiated in endocrine progenitors. Subsequently, in both mouse and chick newly born endocrine cells at the periphery of the epithelium strongly decrease E-cadherin, break-down the basal lamina and cluster into islets of Langerhans. Repression of E-cadherin is sufficient to promote delamination from the epithelium. We further demonstrate that Ngn3 indirectly controls Snail2 protein expression post-transcriptionally to repress E-cadherin. In the chick embryo, Ngn3 independently controls epithelium delamination and differentiation programs. Developmental Dynamics 240:589–604, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {All pancreatic endocrine cells, producing glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, or PP, differentiate from Pdx1+ progenitors that transiently express Neurogenin3. To understand whether the competence of pancreatic progenitors changes over time, we generated transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Ngn3 fusion protein under the control of the pdx1 promoter and backcrossed the transgene into the ngn3−/− background, devoid of endogenous endocrine cells. Early activation of Ngn3-ERTM almost exclusively induced glucagon+ cells, while depleting the pool of pancreas progenitors. As from E11.5, Pdx1+ progenitors became competent to differentiate into insulin+ and PP+ cells. Somatostatin+ cells were generated from E14.5, while the competence to make glucagon+ cells was dramatically decreased. Hence, pancreas progenitors, similar to retinal or cortical progenitors, go through competence states that each allow the generation of a subset of cell types. We further show that the progenitors acquire competence to generate late-born cells in a mechanism that is intrinsic to the epithelium.},

	abstract = {Aims
Spatially-organized increases in cytosolic Ca2+ within pancreatic beta cells in the pancreatic islet underlie the stimulation of insulin secretion by high glucose. Recent data have revealed the existence of subpopulations of beta cells including “leaders” which initiate Ca2+ waves. Whether leader cells possess unique molecular features, or localisation, is unknown.
Main methods
High speed confocal Ca2+ imaging was used to identify leader cells and connectivity analysis, running under MATLAB and Python, to identify highly connected “hub” cells. To explore transcriptomic differences between beta cell sub-groups, individual leaders or followers were labelled by photo-activation of the cryptic fluorescent protein PA-mCherry and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing (“Flash-Seq”).
Key findings
Distinct Ca2+ wave types were identified in individual islets, with leader cells present in 73 \% (28 of 38 islets imaged). Scale-free, power law-adherent behaviour was also observed in 29 \% of islets, though “hub” cells in these islets did not overlap with leaders. Transcripts differentially expressed (295; padj {\textless} 0.05) between leader and follower cells included genes involved in cilium biogenesis and transcriptional regulation. Providing some support for these findings, ADCY6 immunoreactivity tended to be higher in leader than follower cells, whereas cilia number and length tended to be lower in the former. Finally, leader cells were located significantly closer to delta, but not alpha, cells in Euclidian space than were follower cells.
Significance
The existence of both a discrete transcriptome and unique localisation implies a role for these features in defining the specialized function of leaders. These data also raise the possibility that localised signalling between delta and leader cells contributes to the initiation and propagation of islet Ca2+ waves.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis
Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and trigger transcriptional regulation of genes important for islet response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile Ca2+-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular Ca2+ signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity.

Methods
We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mmol/l glucose; (2) 16 mmol/l glucose and 40 mmol/l KCl to maximally stimulate Ca2+ signalling; and (3) 16 mmol/l glucose, 40 mmol/l KCl and 5 mmol/l EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) to inhibit Ca2+ signalling, for 1 h. We sequenced 68,650 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 59,373 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed Ca2+-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.

Results
Based on the number of Ca2+-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of Ca2+ response. We also showed that polyhormonal clusters expressing both INS and GCG, or both INS and SST, are defined by Ca2+-regulated genes specific to each cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of Ca2+-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function.

Conclusions/interpretation
Here we use our large-scale, multi-condition, single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific Ca2+-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of Ca2+-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

Here, we present detailed transcriptomic analysis of the various cell types of the developing human pancreas, including their spatial gene patterns. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics at multiple developmental time points and revealed distinct temporal-spatial gene cascades. Cell trajectory inference identiﬁed endocrine progenitor populations and branch-speciﬁc genes as the progenitors differentiate toward alpha or beta cells. Spatial differentiation trajectories indicated that Schwann cells are spatially co-located with endocrine progenitors, and cell-cell connectivity analysis predicted that they may interact via L1CAMEPHB2 signaling. Our integrated approach enabled us to identify heterogeneity and multiple lineage dynamics within the mesenchyme, showing that it contributed to the exocrine acinar cell state.

It has been known for some time, however, that beta cells are not functionally identical to each other and that the rates of insulin synthesis and release differ from cell to cell, although the functional significance of this variability remains unclear. Recent studies have used heterogeneous gene expression to isolate and evaluate different subpopulations of beta cells and to demonstrate alterations in these subpopulations in diabetes. In the last few years, novel technologies have emerged that permit the detailed evaluation of the proteome (e.g. time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, [CyTOF]) and transcriptome (e.g. massively parallel RNA sequencing) at the single-cell level, and tools for single beta cell metabolomics and epigenomics are quickly maturing. The first wave of single beta cell proteome and transcriptome studies were published in 2016, giving a glimpse into the power, but also the limitations, of these approaches. Despite this progress, it remains unclear if the observed heterogeneity of beta cells represents stable, distinct beta cell types or, alternatively, highly dynamic beta cell states. Here we provide a concise overview of recent developments in the emerging field of beta cell heterogeneity and the implications for our understanding of beta cell biology and pathology.},

Variations in beta cell identity that translate into functionally different subpopulations represent an interesting mechanism to allow beta cells to efficiently respond to diverse physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Recently, there is emerging evidence that morphological and functional differences between beta cells exist. Furthermore, the ability of novel single cell technologies to characterize the molecular identity of individual beta cells has created a new era in the beta cell field. These studies are providing important novel information about the origin of beta cell heterogeneity, the type and proportions of the different beta cell subpopulations, as well as their intrinsic properties. Furthermore, characterization of different beta cell subpopulations that could variably offer protection from or drive progression of diabetes has important clinical implications in diabetes prevention, beta cell regeneration and stem cell treatments. In this review, we will assess the evidence that supports the existence of heterogeneous populations of beta cells and the factors that could influence their formation. We will also address novel studies using islet single cell analysis that have provided important information toward understanding beta cell heterogeneity and discuss the caveats that may be associated with these new technologies.},

However, there is no consensus on cell states and pathways across conditions as well as the value of preclinical mouse models. Since these challenges can only be resolved by jointly analyzing multiple datasets, we present a scRNA-seq cross-condition mouse islet atlas (MIA). We integrated over 300,000 cells from nine datasets with 56 samples, varying in age, sex, and diabetes models, including an autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) model (NOD), a gluco-/lipotoxicity T2D model (db/db), and a chemical streptozotocin (STZ) β-cell ablation model. MIA is a curated resource for interactive exploration and computational querying, providing new insights inaccessible from individual datasets. The β-cell landscape of MIA revealed new disease progression cell states and cross-publication differences between previously suggested marker genes. We show that in the STZ model β-cells transcriptionally correlate to human T2D and mouse db/db, but are less similar to human T1D and mouse NOD. We observe different pathways shared between immature, aged, and diabetes model β-cells. In conclusion, our work presents the first comprehensive analysis of β-cell responses to different stressors, providing a roadmap for the understanding of β-cell plasticity, compensation, and demise.},

In adipose, tissue-resident and recruited T and B cells have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance during diet-induced obesity and ageing, but whether this is paralleled in the pancreatic islets is not known. Here, we investigated the non-macrophage component of resident islet immune cells in islets isolated from C57BL/6 J male mice during ageing (3 to 24 months of age) and following similar weight gain achieved by 12 weeks of 60\% high fat diet.

The secretion of these hormones from pancreatic β-cells and α-cells, respectively, is controlled by metabolic, endocrine, and paracrine regulatory mechanisms and is essential for the control of blood levels of glucose. The deregulation of these mechanisms leads to various pathologies, most notably type 2 diabetes, which is driven by the combined lesions of impaired insulin action and a loss of the normal insulin secretion response to glucose. Glucose stimulates insulin secretion from β-cells in a bi-modal fashion, and new insights about the underlying mechanisms, particularly relating to the second or amplifying phase of this secretory response, have been recently gained. Other recent work highlights the importance of α-cell-produced proglucagon-derived peptides, incretin hormones from the gastrointestinal tract and other dietary components, including certain amino acids and fatty acids, in priming and potentiation of the β-cell glucose response. These advances provide a new perspective for the understanding of the β-cell failure that triggers type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Insulin release from pancreatic β-cells is required to maintain normal glucose homoeostasis in man and many other animals. Defective insulin secretion underlies all forms of diabetes mellitus, a disease currently reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Although the destruction of β-cells is responsible for Type 1 diabetes (T1D), both lowered β-cell mass and loss of secretory function are implicated in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Emerging results suggest that a functional deficiency, involving de-differentiation of the mature β-cell towards a more progenitor-like state, may be an important driver for impaired secretion in T2D. Conversely, at least in rodents, reprogramming of islet non-β to β-cells appears to occur spontaneously in models of T1D, and may occur in man. In the present paper, we summarize the biochemical properties which define the ‘identity’ of the mature β-cell as a glucose sensor par excellence. In particular, we discuss the importance of suppressing a group of 11 ‘disallowed’ housekeeping genes, including Ldha and the monocarboxylate transporter Mct1 (Slc16a1), for normal nutrient sensing. We then survey the changes in the expression and/or activity of β-cell-enriched transcription factors, including FOXO1, PDX1, NKX6.1, MAFA and RFX6, as well as non-coding RNAs, which may contribute to β-cell de-differentiation and functional impairment in T2D. The relevance of these observations for the development of new approaches to treat T1D and T2D is considered.},

Extensive research on pancreas development over the last few years, largely driven by a translational potential for pancreatic diseases (diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and so on), is markedly advancing our knowledge of these processes. It is a tenable goal that we will one day have a clear, complete picture of the transcriptional and signaling codes that control the entire organogenetic process, allowing us to apply this knowledge in a therapeutic context, by generating replacement cells in vitro, or perhaps one day to the whole organ in vivo. This review summarizes findings in the past 5 years that we feel are amongst the most significant in contributing to the deeper understanding of pancreas development. Rather than try to cover all aspects comprehensively, we have chosen to highlight interesting new concepts, and to discuss provocatively some of the more controversial findings or proposals. At the end of the review, we include a perspective section on how the whole pancreas differentiation process might be able to be unwound in a regulated fashion, or redirected, and suggest linkages to the possible reprogramming of other pancreatic cell-types in vivo, and to the optimization of the forward-directed-differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC), or induced pluripotential cells (iPSC), towards mature β-cells.

We analyzed the transcriptomes of single Pdx1low and Pdx1high cells from the DPR and VPR. In the VPR, Pdx1low cells have an intermediate progenitor identity and can generate hepatoblasts, extrahepatobiliary cells, and Pdx1high pancreatic progenitor cells. In the DPR, Pdx1high cells are directly specified as pancreatic progenitors, whereas Pdx1low cells are precocious endocrine cells. Therefore, our study defines distinct road maps for dorsal and ventral pancreatic progenitor specification.

In healthy adults SLC2A2 variants are associated with elevated fasting plasma glucose (fpg) concentrations but physiological characterisation does not support a defect in pancreatic beta-cell function. Interspecies differences can create barriers for the follow up of disease association signals. We hypothesised that GLUT2 is not the principal glucose transporter in human beta-cells and that SLC2A2 variants exert their effect on fpg levels through defects in other tissues. SLC2A1–4 (GLUT 1–4) mRNA expression levels were determined in human and mouse islets, beta-cells, liver, muscle and adipose tissue by qRT-PCR whilst GLUT1–3 protein levels were examined by immunohistochemistry. The presence of all three glucose transporters was demonstrated in human and mouse islets and puriﬁed beta-cells. Quantitative expression proﬁling demonstrated that Slc2a2 is the predominant glucose transporter (expression N 10 fold higher that Slc2a1) in mouse islets whilst SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 predominate in both human islets and beta-cells (expression 2.8 and 2.7 fold higher than SLC2A2 respectively). Our data therefore suggest that GLUT2 is unlikely to be the principal glucose transporter in human beta-cells and that SLC2A2 defects in other metabolic tissues drive the observed differences in glucose levels between carriers of SLC2A2 variants. Direct extrapolation from rodent to human islet glucose transporter activity is unlikely to be appropriate.},

	abstract = {Insulin secretion is triggered by a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration that results from the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the β-cell plasma membrane. Multiple types of β-cell Ca2+ channel have been identified in both electrophysiological and molecular biological studies, but it appears that the L-type Ca2+ channel plays a dominant role in regulating Ca2+ influx. Activity of this channel is potentiated by protein kinases A and C and is inhibited by GTP-binding proteins, which may mediate the effects of potentiators and inhibitors of insulin secretion on Ca2+ influx, respectively. The mechanism by which elevation of intracellular Ca2+ leads to the release of insulin granules is not fully understood but appears to involve activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase A or C, probably at different substrates, potentiates insulin secretion by acting at some late stage in the secretory process. There is also evidence that small GTP-binding proteins are involved in regulating exocytosis in β cells. The identification and characterisation of the proteins involved in exocytosis in β cells and clarification of the mechanism(s) of action of Ca2+ is clearly an important goal for the future. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The pancreas is an organ containing two distinct populations of cells, the exocrine cells that secrete enzymes into the digestive tract, and the endocrine cells that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. It arises from the endoderm as a dorsal and a ventral bud which fuse together to form the single organ. Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have a pancreas with similar histology and mode of development, while in some fish, the islet cells are segregated as Brockmann bodies. Invertebrates do not have a pancreas, but comparable endocrine cells may be found in the gut or the brain. The early pancreatic bud shows uniform expression of the homeobox gene IPF-1 (also known as IDX-1, STF-1 or PDX), which when mutated to inactivity leads to total absence of the organ. The occurrence of heterotopic pancreas in the embryo, and also the metaplasias that can be displayed by a regenerating pancreas in the adult, both suggest that only a few gene products distinguish the pancreatic cell state from that of the surrounding tissues of duodenum, gall bladder and liver. In the developing pancreatic buds, the endocrine cells start to differentiate before the exocrine cells, and co-expression of different hormones by the same cell is often observed at early stages. Although pancreatic endocrine cells produce many gene products also characteristic of neurons, evidence from in vitro cultures and from quailchick grafts shows that they are of endogenous and not of neural crest origin. Observational studies suggest strongly that both endocrine and exocrine cells arise from the same endodermal rudiment. Development of the pancreas in embryonic life requires a trophic stimulus from the associated mesenchyme. In postnatal life, all cell types in the pancreas continue to grow. Destruction of acinar tissue by duct ligation or ethionine treatment is followed by rapid regeneration. Surgical removal of parts of the pancreas is followed by moderate but incomplete regeneration of both acini and islets. Poisoning with alloxan or streptozotocin can lead to permanent depletion of beta cells. Although the cell kinetics of the pancreas are not understood, it seems likely that there is a continuous slow turnover of cells, fed from a stem cells population in the ducts, and that the controls on the production rate of each cell type are local rather than systemic.},

Cells of the posterior foregut assume a pancreatic identity, cells within the expanding pancreatic primordia adopt an endocrine fate, and a subset of these precursors becomes competent to generate β-cells. Postnatally, β-cells are primarily maintained by self-duplication rather than new differentiation. Although major gaps in our knowledge still persist, experiments across several organisms have shed increasing light on the steps of β-cell specification and differentiation. Increasing our understanding of the extrinsic, as well as intrinsic, mechanisms that control these processes should facilitate efforts to regenerate this important cell type in humans.},

With declining mortality from vascular disease, which once accounted for more than 50\% of deaths amongst people with diabetes mellitus, cancer and dementia now comprise the leading causes of death in people with diabetes mellitus in some countries or regions. Additionally, studies have demonstrated notable links between diabetes mellitus and a broad range of comorbidities, including cognitive decline, functional disability, affective disorders, obstructive sleep apnoea and liver disease, and have refined our understanding of the association between diabetes mellitus and infection. However, no published review currently synthesizes this evidence to provide an in-depth discussion of the burden and risks of these emerging complications. This Review summarizes information from systematic reviews and major cohort studies regarding emerging complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus to identify and quantify associations, highlight gaps and discrepancies in the evidence, and consider implications for the future management of diabetes mellitus.},

Diabetes in its many forms and T2DM have different physiological backgrounds and are difficult to classify. Bariatric surgery (BS) is considered the most effective treatment for obesity in terms of weight loss and comorbidity resolution, improves diabetes, and has been proven superior to medical management for the treatment of diabetes. The term metabolic surgery (MS) describes bariatric surgical procedures used primarily to treat T2DM and related metabolic conditions. MS is the most effective means of obtaining substantial and durable weight loss in individuals with obesity. Originally, BS was used as an alternative weight-loss therapy for patients with severe obesity, but clinical data revealed its metabolic benefits in patients with T2DM. MS is more effective than lifestyle or medical management in achieving glycaemic control, sustained weight loss, and reducing diabetes comorbidities. New guidelines for T2DM expand the use of MS to patients with a lower body mass index.},

Genetic information is expected to play a vital role in the prediction of T2D, and many efforts have been made to develop T2D risk models that include both conventional and genetic risk factors. Yet, because most T2D genetic variants identified have small effect size individually (10\%-20\% increased risk of T2D per risk allele), their clinical utility remains unclear. Most studies report that a genetic risk score combining multiple T2D genetic variants does not substantially improve T2D risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncertainties persist about the magnitude of associations of diabetes mellitus and fasting glucose concentration with risk of coronary heart disease and major stroke subtypes. We aimed to quantify these associations for a wide range of circumstances.
METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of individual records of diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentration, and other risk factors in people without initial vascular disease from studies in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration. We combined within-study regressions that were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and body-mass index to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for vascular disease.
FINDINGS: Analyses included data for 698 782 people (52 765 non-fatal or fatal vascular outcomes; 8.49 million person-years at risk) from 102 prospective studies. Adjusted HRs with diabetes were: 2.00 (95\% CI 1.83-2.19) for coronary heart disease; 2.27 (1.95-2.65) for ischaemic stroke; 1.56 (1.19-2.05) for haemorrhagic stroke; 1.84 (1.59-2.13) for unclassified stroke; and 1.73 (1.51-1.98) for the aggregate of other vascular deaths. HRs did not change appreciably after further adjustment for lipid, inflammatory, or renal markers. HRs for coronary heart disease were higher in women than in men, at 40-59 years than at 70 years and older, and with fatal than with non-fatal disease. At an adult population-wide prevalence of 10\%, diabetes was estimated to account for 11\% (10-12\%) of vascular deaths. Fasting blood glucose concentration was non-linearly related to vascular risk, with no significant associations between 3.90 mmol/L and 5.59 mmol/L. Compared with fasting blood glucose concentrations of 3.90-5.59 mmol/L, HRs for coronary heart disease were: 1.07 (0.97-1.18) for lower than 3.90 mmol/L; 1.11 (1.04-1.18) for 5.60-6.09 mmol/L; and 1.17 (1.08-1.26) for 6.10-6.99 mmol/L. In people without a history of diabetes, information about fasting blood glucose concentration or impaired fasting glucose status did not significantly improve metrics of vascular disease prediction when added to information about several conventional risk factors.
INTERPRETATION: Diabetes confers about a two-fold excess risk for a wide range of vascular diseases, independently from other conventional risk factors. In people without diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentration is modestly and non-linearly associated with risk of vascular disease.

	abstract = {Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is central to normal control of metabolic fuel homeostasis, and its impairment is a key element of β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Glucose exerts its effects on insulin secretion via its metabolism in β-cells to generate stimulus/secretion coupling factors, including a rise in the ATP/ADP ratio, which serves to suppress ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels and activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, leading to stimulation of insulin granule exocytosis. Whereas this KATP channel-dependent mechanism of GSIS has been broadly accepted for more than 30 years, it has become increasingly apparent that it does not fully describe the effects of glucose on insulin secretion. More recent studies have demonstrated an important role for cyclic pathways of pyruvate metabolism in control of insulin secretion. Three cycles occur in islet β-cells: the pyruvate/malate, pyruvate/citrate, and pyruvate/isocitrate cycles. This review discusses recent work on the role of each of these pathways in control of insulin secretion and builds a case for the particular relevance of byproducts of the pyruvate/isocitrate cycle, NADPH and α-ketoglutarate, in control of GSIS.},

	doi = {10.2337/diabetes.49.11.1751},
	abstract = {Glucose stimulates insulin secretion by generating triggering and amplifying signals in beta-cells. The triggering pathway is well characterized. It involves the following sequence of events: entry of glucose by facilitated diffusion, metabolism of glucose by oxidative glycolysis, rise in the ATP-to-ADP ratio, closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx, rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and activation of the exocytotic machinery. The amplifying pathway can be studied when beta-cell [Ca2+]i is elevated and clamped by a depolarization with either a high concentration of sulfonylurea or a high concentration of K+ in the presence of diazoxide (K(ATP) channels are then respectively blocked or held open). Under these conditions, glucose still increases insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase in secretion is highly sensitive to glucose (produced by as little as 1-6 mmol/l glucose), requires glucose metabolism, is independent of activation of protein kinases A and C, and does not seem to implicate long-chain acyl-CoAs. Changes in adenine nucleotides may be involved. The amplification consists of an increase in efficacy of Ca2+ on exocytosis of insulin granules. There exists a clear hierarchy between both pathways. The triggering pathway predominates over the amplifying pathway, which remains functionally silent as long as [Ca2+]i has not been raised by the first pathway; i.e., as long as glucose has not reached its threshold concentration. The alteration of this hierarchy by long-acting sulfonylureas or genetic inactivation of K(ATP) channels may lead to inappropriate insulin secretion at low glucose. The amplifying pathway serves to optimize the secretory response not only to glucose but also to nonglucose stimuli. It is impaired in beta-cells of animal models of type 2 diabetes, and indirect evidence suggests that it is altered in beta-cells of type 2 diabetic patients. Besides the available drugs that act on K(ATP) channels and increase the triggering signal, novel drugs that correct a deficient amplifying pathway would be useful to restore adequate insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients.},

	abstract = {Finding novel causes for monogenic forms of diabetes is important as, alongside the clinical implications of such a discovery, it can identify critical proteins and pathways required for normal beta cell function in humans. It is increasingly apparent that there are significant differences between rodent and human islets. One example that has generated interest is the relative importance of the glucose transporter GLUT2 in rodent and human beta cells. The central role of GLUT2 in rodent beta cells is well established, but a number of studies have suggested that other glucose transporters, namely GLUT1 and GLUT3, may play an important role in facilitating glucose transport into human beta cells. In this issue of Diabetologia Sansbury et al (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-012-2595-0 ) report homozygous loss of function mutations in SLC2A2, which encodes GLUT2, as a rare cause of neonatal diabetes. Evidence for a beta cell defect in these subjects comes from very low birthweights, lack of endogenous insulin secretion and a requirement for insulin therapy. Neonatal diabetes is not a consistent feature of SLC2A2 mutations. It is only found in a small percentage of cases ({\textasciitilde}4\%) and the diabetes largely resolves before 18 months of age. This discovery is significant as it suggests that GLUT2 plays an important role in human beta cells, but the interplay and relative roles of other transporters differ from those in rodents. This finding should encourage efforts to delineate the precise role of GLUT2 in the human beta cell at different developmental time points and is a further reminder of critical differences between human and rodent islets.},

	abstract = {The function and survival of pancreatic β cells critically rely on complex electrical signaling systems composed of a series of ionic events, namely fluxes of K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Cl− across the β cell membranes. These electrical signaling systems not only sense events occurring in the extracellular space and intracellular milieu of pancreatic islet cells, but also control different β cell activities, most notably glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Three major ion fluxes including K+ efflux through ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, the voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channel-mediated Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux through voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels operate in the β cell. These ion fluxes set the resting membrane potential and the shape, rate and pattern of firing of action potentials under different metabolic conditions. The KATP channel-mediated K+ efflux determines the resting membrane potential and keeps the excitability of the β cell at low levels. Ca2+ influx through CaV1 channels, a major type of β cell CaV channels, causes the upstroke or depolarization phase of the action potential and regulates a wide range of β cell functions including the most elementary β cell function, insulin secretion. K+ efflux mediated by KV2.1 delayed rectifier K+ channels, a predominant form of β cell KV channels, brings about the downstroke or repolarization phase of the action potential, which acts as a brake for insulin secretion owing to shutting down the CaV channel-mediated Ca2+ entry. These three ion channel-mediated ion fluxes are the most important ionic events in β cell signaling. This review concisely discusses various ionic mechanisms in β cell signaling and highlights KATP channel-, CaV1 channel- and KV2.1 channel-mediated ion fluxes.},

	abstract = {Physiologically, insulin secretion is subject to a dual, hierarchal control by triggering and amplifying pathways. By closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) in the plasma membrane, glucose and other metabolized nutrients depolarize β-cells, stimulate Ca2+ influx, and increase the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which constitutes the indispensable triggering signal to induce exocytosis of insulin granules. The increase in β-cell metabolism also generates amplifying signals that augment the efficacy of Ca2+ on the exocytotic machinery. Stimulatory hormones and neurotransmitters modestly increase the triggering signal and strongly activate amplifying pathways biochemically distinct from that set into operation by nutrients. Many drugs can increase insulin secretion in vitro, but only few have a therapeutic potential. This review identifies six major pathways or sites of stimulus-secretion coupling that could be aimed by potential insulin-secreting drugs and describes several strategies to reach these targets. It also discusses whether these perspectives are realistic or theoretical only. These six possible β-cell targets are 1) stimulation of metabolism, 2) increase of [Ca2+]i by closure of K+ATP channels, 3) increase of [Ca2+]i by other means, 4) stimulation of amplifying pathways, 5) action on membrane receptors, and 6) action on nuclear receptors. The theoretical risk of inappropriate insulin secretion and, hence, of hypoglycemia linked to these different approaches is also envisaged.},

	abstract = {The consensus model of stimulus-secretion coupling in beta cells attributes glucose-induced insulin secretion to a sequence of events involving acceleration of metabolism, closure of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, depolarisation, influx of Ca(2+) and a rise in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)). This triggering pathway is essential, but would not be very efficient if glucose did not also activate a metabolic amplifying pathway that does not raise [Ca(2+)](c) further but augments the action of triggering Ca(2+) on exocytosis. This review discusses how both pathways interact to achieve temporal control and amplitude modulation of biphasic insulin secretion. First-phase insulin secretion is triggered by the rise in [Ca(2+)](c) that occurs synchronously in all beta cells of every islet in response to a sudden increase in the glucose concentration. Its time course and duration are shaped by those of the Ca(2+) signal, and its amplitude is modulated by the magnitude of the [Ca(2+)](c) rise and, substantially, by amplifying mechanisms. During the second phase, synchronous [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations in all beta cells of an individual islet induce pulsatile insulin secretion, but these features of the signal and response are dampened in groups of intrinsically asynchronous islets. Glucose has hardly any influence on the amplitude of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations and mainly controls the time course of triggering signal. Amplitude modulation of insulin secretion pulses largely depends on the amplifying pathway. There are more similarities than differences between the two phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Both are subject to the same dual, hierarchical control over time and amplitude by triggering and amplifying pathways, suggesting that the second phase is a sequence of iterations of the first phase.},

Both messengers are also positive modulators of glucagon release from α-cells, but in this case cAMP may be the important regulator and Ca2+ have a more permissive role. The actions of cAMP are mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac. The present review focuses on how cAMP is regulated by nutrients, hormones and neural factors in β- and α-cells via adenylyl cyclase-catalysed generation and phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation. We will also discuss how PKA and Epac affect ion fluxes and the secretory machinery to transduce the stimulatory effects on insulin and glucagon secretion.

	abstract = {Objective
α/β-Hydrolase domain-6 (ABHD6) is a newly identified monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase. We recently reported that it negatively regulates glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the β cells by hydrolyzing lipolysis-derived MAG that acts as a metabolic coupling factor and signaling molecule via exocytotic regulator Munc13-1. Whether ABHD6 and MAG play a role in response to all classes of insulin secretagogues, in particular various fuel and non-fuel stimuli, is unknown.
Methods
Insulin secretion in response to various classes of secretagogues, exogenous MAG and pharmacological agents was measured in islets of mice deficient in ABHD6 specifically in the β cell (BKO). Islet perifusion experiments and determinations of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, cytosolic Ca2+ and MAG species levels were carried out.
Results
Deletion of ABHD6 potentiated insulin secretion in response to the fuels glutamine plus leucine and α-ketoisocaproate and to the non-fuel stimuli glucagon-like peptide 1, carbamylcholine and elevated KCl. Fatty acids amplified GSIS in control and BKO mice to the same extent. Exogenous 1-MAG amplified insulin secretion in response to fuel and non-fuel stimuli. MAG hydrolysis activity was greatly reduced in BKO islets without changes in total diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol lipase activity. ABHD6 deletion induced insulin secretion independently from KATP channels and did not alter the glucose induced rise in intracellular Ca2+. Perifusion studies showed elevated insulin secretion during second phase of GSIS in BKO islets that was not due to altered cytosolic Ca2+ signaling or because of changes in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Glucose increased islet saturated long chain 1-MAG species and ABHD6 deletion caused accumulation of these 1-MAG species at both low and elevated glucose.
Conclusion
ABHD6 regulates insulin secretion in response to fuel stimuli at large and some non-fuel stimuli by controlling long chain saturated 1-MAG levels that synergize with other signaling pathways for secretion.},

	abstract = {Aims/Introduction Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the circulation. In this study, we investigated cell signaling in the amplification of insulin secretion by glutamine. Materials and Methods Clonal pancreatic β-cells MIN6-K8, wild-type B6 mouse islets, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) knockout clonal β-cells (Glud1KOβCL), and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) knockout clonal β-cells (Got1KOβCL) were studied. Insulin secretion from these cells and islets was examined under various conditions, and intracellular glutamine metabolism was assessed by metabolic flux analysis. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was also measured. Results Glutamine dose-dependently amplified insulin secretion in the presence of high glucose in both MIN6-K8 cells and Glud1KOβCL. Inhibition of glutaminases, the enzymes that convert glutamine to glutamate, dramatically reduced the glutamine-amplifying effect on insulin secretion. A substantial amount of glutamate was produced from glutamine through direct conversion by glutaminases. Glutamine also increased [Ca2+]i at high glucose, which was abolished by inhibition of glutaminases. Glutamic acid dimethylester (dm-Glu), a membrane permeable glutamate precursor that is converted to glutamate in cells, increased [Ca2+]i as well as induced insulin secretion at high glucose. These effects of glutamine and dm-Glu were dependent on calcium influx. Glutamine also induced insulin secretion in clonal β-cells MIN6-m14, which otherwise exhibit no insulin secretory response to glucose. Conclusions Glutamate converted from glutamine is an essential mediator that enhances calcium signaling in the glutamine-amplifying effect on insulin secretion. Our data also suggest that glutamine exerts a permissive effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion.},

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is necessary to perform this type of analysis in frozen or difficult-to-dissociate tissues, which cannot be subjected to scRNA-seq. This difference in the state of tissues leads to variation in cell-type distributions among each platform. To identify the characteristics of these methods and their differences, scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq were performed in parallel for colon and liver tissues. The two platforms revealed similar diversity but different proportions of cell types in matched tissues. The proportions of epithelial cells in the colon and hepatocytes in the liver were relatively high in snRNA-seq and that of immune cells was relatively high in scRNA-seq. This difference could be explained by variations in the expression scores of adhesion genes due to the disruption of the cytoplasmic contents during scRNA-seq. The enrichment of epithelial cells in the colon resulted in a discrepancy in the differentiation of epithelial cells. This enrichment was also well matched with the images of hematoxylin and eosin staining and the estimated distribution of cell types in bulk RNA sequencing. These results showed that snRNA-seq could be used to analyze tissues that cannot be subjected to scRNA-seq and provides more information in specific cell type analysis.},

Recent advances in molecular technologies, in particular single-cell profiling on both the protein and messenger RNA level, have uncovered that β-cells exist in several antigenically and molecularly definable states. Using antibodies to cell surface markers or multidimensional clustering of β-cells using more than 20 protein markers by mass cytometry, 4 distinct groups of β-cells could be differentiated. However, whether these states represent permanent cell lineages or are readily interconvertible from one group to another remains to be determined. Nevertheless, future analysis of the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes will certainly benefit from a growing appreciation of β-cell heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Background
Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated actions of hormone-producing endocrine cells that reside in pancreatic islets. Islet cell malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression. Due to the cellular heterogeneity within islets, it has been challenging to uncover how specific islet cells contribute to glucose homeostasis and diabetes pathogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell technologies and computational methods have opened up new avenues to resolve islet heterogeneity and study islet cell states in health and disease.
Scope of review
In the past year, a multitude of studies have been published that used single-cell approaches to interrogate the transcriptome and proteome of the different islet cell types. Here, we summarize the conclusions of these studies, as well as discuss the technologies used and the challenges faced with computational analysis of single-cell data from islet studies.
Major conclusions
By analyzing single islet cells from rodents and humans at different ages and disease states, the studies reviewed here have provided new insight into endocrine cell function and facilitated a high resolution molecular characterization of poorly understood processes, including regeneration, maturation, and diabetes pathogenesis. Gene expression programs and pathways identified in these studies pave the way for the discovery of new targets and approaches to prevent, monitor, and treat diabetes.},

To understand the impact of aging on beta cells, we performed meta-analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, transcription factor (TF) regulon analysis, high-resolution confocal microscopy, and measured insulin secretion from nondiabetic donors spanning most of the human life span. This revealed the range of molecular and functional changes that occur during beta cell aging, including the transcriptional deregulation that associates with cellular immaturity and reorganization of beta cell TF networks, increased gene transcription rates, and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin release. These alterations associate with activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy pathways. We propose that a chronic state of ER stress undermines old beta cell structure function to increase the risk of beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes onset as humans age.},

Additionally, studies on hMPCs have been hindered by few isolation methods that allow for the recovery of live cells. Here, we investigated the tip progenitor domain in the branched epithelium of human fetal pancreas between 13.5 and 17.5 gestational weeks by immunohistological staining. We also used a novel RNA‐based technology to isolate live cells followed by gene expression analyses. We identified cells co‐expressing SOX9 and PTF1A, two transcription factors known to be important for pancreatic MPCs, within the tips of the epithelium and observed a decrease in their proportions over time. Pancreatic SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells were enriched for MPC markers, including MYC and GATA6. These cells were proliferative and appeared active in branching morphogenesis and matrix remodeling, as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis. We identified a hub of genes pertaining to the expanding tip progenitor niche, such as FOXF1, GLI3, TBX3, FGFR1, TGFBR2, ITGAV, ITGA2, and ITGB3. YAP1 of the Hippo pathway emerged as a highly enriched component within the SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing further corroborated the findings by identifying a cluster of SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells with multipotent characteristics. Based on these results, we propose that the SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells in the human pancreas are uncommitted MPC‐like cells that reside at the tips of the expanding pancreatic epithelium, directing self‐renewal and inducing pancreatic organogenesis. stem cells translational medicine

	abstract = {Background
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common chronic diseases. Studies on T2D are mainly built upon bulk-cell data analysis, which measures the average gene expression levels for a population of cells and cannot capture the inter-cell heterogeneity. The single-cell RNA-sequencing technology can provide additional information about the molecular mechanisms of T2D at single-cell level.

Results
In this work, we analyze three datasets of single-cell transcriptomes to reveal β-cell dysfunction and deficit mechanisms in T2D. Focused on the expression levels of key genes, we conduct discrimination of healthy and T2D β-cells using five machine learning classifiers, and extracted major influential factors by calculating correlation coefficients and mutual information. Our analysis shows that T2D β-cells are normal in insulin gene expression in the scenario of low cellular stress (especially oxidative stress), but appear dysfunctional under the circumstances of high cellular stress. Remarkably, oxidative stress plays an important role in affecting the expression of insulin gene. In addition, by analyzing the genes related to apoptosis, we found that the TNFR1-, BAX-, CAPN1- and CAPN2-dependent pathways may be crucial for β-cell apoptosis in T2D. Finally, personalized analysis indicates cell heterogeneity and individual-specific insulin gene expression.

Conclusions
Oxidative stress is an important influential factor on insulin gene expression in T2D. Based on the uncovered mechanism of β-cell dysfunction and deficit, targeting key genes in the apoptosis pathway along with alleviating oxidative stress could be a potential treatment strategy for T2D.

The role of the two nucleotide binding folds of SUR1 in regulation of KATP channel activity by nucleotides and diazoxide was investigated. Mutations in the linker region and the Walker B motif (Walker, J.E., M.J. Saraste, M.J. Runswick, and N.J. Gay. 1982. EMBO [Eur. Mol. Biol.

Analogous mutations in the first nucleotide binding fold, including G827D, G827R, and Q834H, were still stimulated by diazoxide and MgADP, but with altered kinetics compared with the wild-type channel. None of the mutations altered the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by ATP4-. We propose a model in which SUR1 sensitizes the KATP channel to ATP inhibition, and nucleotide hydrolysis at the nucleotide binding folds blocks this effect. MgADP and diazoxide are proposed to stabilize this desensitized state of the channel, and mutations at the nucleotide binding folds alter the response of channels to MgADP and diazoxide by altering nucleotide hydrolysis rates or the coupling of hydrolysis to channel activation.},

	abstract = {Glucose stimulation of insulin release involves closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, depolarization, and Ca2+ influx in B cells. Mouse islets were used to investigate whether glucose can still regulate insulin release when it cannot control ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Opening of these channels by diazoxide (100-250 mumol/liter) blocked the effects of glucose on B cell membrane potential (intracellular microelectrodes), free cytosolic Ca2+ (fura-2 method), and insulin release, but it did not prevent those of high K (30 mmol/liter). K-induced insulin release in the presence of diazoxide was, however, dose dependently increased by glucose, which was already effective at concentrations (2-6 mmol/liter) that are subthreshold under normal conditions (low K and no diazoxide). This effect was not accompanied by detectable changes in B cell membrane potential. Measurements of 45Ca fluxes and cytosolic Ca2+ indicated that glucose slightly increased Ca2+ influx during the first minutes of depolarization by K, but not in the steady state when its effect on insulin release was the largest. In conclusion, there exists a mechanism by which glucose can control insulin release independently from changes in K(+)-ATP channel activity, in membrane potential, and in cytosolic Ca2+. This mechanism may serve to amplify the secretory response to the triggering signal (closure of K(+)-ATP channels--depolarization--Ca2+ influx) induced by glucose.},

It is unclear if and how nutrients can regulate insulin secretion by beta-cells lacking K(ATP) channels (Sur1 knockout mice). We compared glucose- and amino acid-induced insulin secretion and [Ca(2+)](i) changes in control and Sur1KO islets. In 1 mm glucose (non-stimulatory for controls), the triggering signal [Ca(2+)](i) was high (loss of regulation) and insulin secretion was stimulated in Sur1KO islets. This "basal" secretion was decreased or increased by imposed changes in [Ca(2+)](i) and was dependent on ATP production, indicating that both triggering and amplifying signals are involved. High glucose stimulated insulin secretion in Sur1KO islets, by an unsuspected, transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a sustained activation of the amplifying pathway. Unlike controls, Sur1KO islets were insensitive to diazoxide and tolbutamide, which rules out effects of either drug at sites other than K(ATP) channels. Amino acids potently increased insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets through both a further electrogenic rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and a metabolism-dependent activation of the amplifying pathway. After sulfonylurea blockade of their K(ATP) channels, control islets qualitatively behaved like Sur1KO islets, but their insulin secretion rate was consistently lower for a similar or even higher [Ca(2+)](i). In conclusion, fuel secretagogues can control insulin secretion in beta-cells without K(ATP) channels, partly by an unsuspected influence on the triggering [Ca(2+)](i) signal and mainly by the modulation of a very effective amplifying pathway.},

Although the resting membrane potential and basal intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) of pancreatic beta cells in Kir6.2(-/-) are significantly higher than those in control mice (Kir6.2(+/+)), neither glucose at high concentrations nor the sulfonylurea tolbutamide elicits a rise in [Ca2+]i, and no significant insulin secretion in response to either glucose or tolbutamide is found in Kir6.2(-/-), as assessed by perifusion and batch incubation of pancreatic islets. Despite the defect in glucose-induced insulin secretion, Kir6.2(-/-) show only mild impairment in glucose tolerance. The glucose-lowering effect of insulin, as assessed by an insulin tolerance test, is increased significantly in Kir6.2(-/-), which could protect Kir6.2(-/-) from developing hyperglycemia. Our data indicate that the KATP channel in pancreatic beta cells is a key regulator of both glucose- and sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion and suggest also that the KATP channel in skeletal muscle might be involved in insulin action.},

Here, we characterized the effects of glucose in beta-cells lacking K ATP channels because of a knockout (KO) of the pore-forming subunit Kir6.2. Islets from 1-yr and 2-wk-old Kir6.2KO mice were used freshly after isolation and after 18 h culture to measure glucose effects on [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion. Kir6.2KO islets were insensitive to diazoxide and tolbutamide. In fresh adult Kir6.2KO islets, basal [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion were marginally elevated, and high glucose increased [Ca2+]c only transiently, so that the secretory response was minimal (10\% of controls) despite a functioning amplifying pathway (evidenced in 30 mm KCl). Culture in 10 mm glucose increased basal secretion and considerably improved glucose-induced insulin secretion (200\% of controls), unexpectedly because of an increase in [Ca2+]c with modulation of [Ca2+]c oscillations. Similar results were obtained in 2-wk-old Kir6.2KO islets. Under selected conditions, high glucose evoked biphasic increases in [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion, by inducing K ATP channel-independent depolarization and Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. In conclusion, Kir6.2KO beta-cells down-regulate insulin secretion by maintaining low [Ca2+]c, but culture reveals a glucose-responsive phenotype mainly by increasing [Ca2+]c. The results support models implicating a K ATP channel-independent amplifying pathway in glucose-induced insulin secretion, and show that K ATP channels are not the only possible transducers of metabolic effects on the triggering Ca2+ signal.},

In sharp contrast, 16.7 mM glucose ([G16.7]) applied simultaneously with [K+50] elicits an insulin response markedly greater than that produced by [K+50] alone, which is not attenuated by 100 uM diazoxide, an inhibitor of K+ATP channel closure. [G16.7]-induced insulin secretion at the basal K+ concn of 4.7 mM was greatly (93\%) suppressed by 100 uM diazoxide. Insulin secretion induced by [K+50] plus [G16.7] ([K+50 + G16.7]) was markedly suppressed (70\%) by 1 uM nifedipine, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker and was completely abolished by 2 mM 2-cyclohexen-1-one, which reportedly decreases reduced glutathione level and blocks glucokinase. This finding indicates that insulin release induced by [K+50 + G16.7] is not due to leakage produced by toxic stimuli but to activation of exocytosis. When graded concentrations (25 and 50 mM) of K+ were applied simultaneously with [G16.7] in the presence of 100 uM diazoxide, insulin response was clearly dependent on K+ concentration, indicating that the physiological range of membrane depolarization also activates the glucose-responsive effector. Membrane depolarization/Ca2+ influx directly stimulates hormone exocytosis on one hand and activates the K+ATP channel-independent glucose-responsive effector or effectors on the other in the B-cell. The nature of the glucose-responsive effector or effectors remains to be established.},

	abstract = {Glucose-induced insulin secretion in response to a step increase in blood glucose concentrations follows a biphasic time course consisting of a rapid and transient first phase followed by a slowly developing and sustained second phase. Because Type 2 diabetes involves defects of insulin secretion, manifested as a loss of first phase and a reduction of second phase, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying biphasic insulin secretion. Insulin release involves the packaging of insulin in small (diameter ≈0.3 µm) secretory granules, the trafficking of these granules to the plasma membrane, the exocytotic fusion of the granules with the plasma membrane and eventually the retrieval of the secreted membranes by endocytosis. Until recently, studies on insulin secretion have been confined to the appearance of insulin in the extracellular space and the cellular events preceding exocytosis have been inaccessible to more detailed analysis. Evidence from a variety of secretory tissues, including pancreatic islet cells suggests, however, that the secretory granules can be functionally divided into distinct pools that are distinguished by their release competence and/or proximity to the plasma membrane. The introduction of fluorescent proteins that can be targeted to the secretory granules, in combination with the advent of new techniques that allow real-time imaging of granule trafficking in living cells (granule dynamics), has led to an explosion of our knowledge of the pre-exocytotic and post-exocytotic processes in the beta cell. Here we discuss these observations in relation to previous functional and ultra-structural data as well as the secretory defects of Type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Phases of insulin release were studied in the perfused pancreas during a variety of glucose stimulation patterns. Patterns included staircase stimulations, constant prolonged single steps, restimulations, and ramp functions. Except at low concentrations, prolonged single steps of glucose elicited early spikes of insulin and a slowly rising second phase. Total insulin in the initial spikes increased with higher glucose concentrations. However, the time-related pattern of these spikes was similar in all cases; ratios of initial secretion rate to total insulin released were constant. Total insulin released in this early phase approximated a sigmoidal function of glucose concentration; mathematical differentiation of this function gave a skewed bell-shaped distribution curve. Staircase stimulations caused insulin to be released as a series of transient spikes which did not correlate with the increment of glucose but rather to the available insulin for a given glucose concentration minus that released in previous steps. The sum of total insulin released as spikes in a staircase series leading to a given glucose concentration was the same as when that concentration was used as a single step. Interrupted prolonged glucose infusions indicated the second phase of insulin release could prime the pancreas and that the first and second phases were interrelated. When glucose was perfused as ramp functions of slow, increasing, concentration, phasic response disappeared.A previous two-compartmental model was expanded to include a threshold or sensitivity distribution hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that labile insulin is not stored in a homogeneous form but as packets with a bell-shaped distribution of thresholds to glucose. These packets respond quickly when their threshold levels to glucose are reached or exceeded. Data from single step stimulations were utilized for constructing a mathematical model which simulated satisfactorily the various stimulation patterns.},

The metabolic amplifying pathway augments IS without further increasing [Ca(2+)](c). The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that amplification implicates actin microfilaments. Mouse islets were treated with latrunculin B and cytochalasin B to depolymerize actin or jasplakinolide to polymerize actin. They were then perifused to measure [Ca(2+)](c) and IS. Metabolic amplification was studied during imposed steady elevation of [Ca(2+)](c) by tolbutamide or KCl or by comparing the magnitude of [Ca(2+)](c) and IS changes produced by glucose and tolbutamide. Both actin polymerization and depolymerization augmented IS triggered by all stimuli without increasing (sometimes decreasing) [Ca(2+)](c), which indicates a predominantly inhibitory function of microfilaments in exocytosis at a step distal to [Ca(2+)](c) increase. When [Ca(2+)](c) was elevated and controlled by KCl or tolbutamide, the amplifying action of glucose was facilitated by actin depolymerization and unaffected by polymerization. Both phases of IS were larger in response to high-glucose than to tolbutamide in low-glucose, although triggering [Ca(2+)](c) was lower. This difference in IS, due to amplification, persisted when the IS rate was doubled by actin depolymerization or polymerization. In conclusion, metabolic amplification is rapid and influences the first as well as the second phase of IS. It is a late step of stimulus-secretion coupling, which does not require functional actin microfilaments and could correspond to acceleration of the priming process conferring release competence to insulin granules.},

The metabolic amplifying pathway augments IS without further increasing [Ca(2+)](c). After exclusion of the contribution of actin microfilaments, we here tested whether amplification implicates microtubule-dependent granule mobilization. Mouse islets were treated with nocodazole or taxol, which completely depolymerized and polymerized tubulin. They were then perifused to measure [Ca(2+)](c) and IS. Metabolic amplification was studied during imposed steady elevation of [Ca(2+)](c) by tolbutamide or KCl or by comparing [Ca(2+)](c) and IS responses to glucose and tolbutamide. Nocodazole did not alter [Ca(2+)](c) or IS changes induced by the three secretagogues, whereas taxol caused a small inhibition of IS that is partly ascribed to a decrease in [Ca(2+)](c). When [Ca(2+)](c) was elevated and controlled by KCl or tolbutamide, the amplifying action of glucose was unaffected by microtubule disruption or stabilization. Both phases of IS were larger in response to glucose than tolbutamide, although triggering [Ca(2+)](c) was lower. This difference, due to amplification, persisted in nocodazole- or taxol-treated islets, even when IS was augmented fourfold by microfilament disruption with cytochalasin B or latrunculin B. In conclusion, metabolic amplification rapidly augments first and second phases of IS independently of insulin granule translocation along microtubules. We therefore extend our previous proposal that it does not implicate the cytoskeleton but corresponds to acceleration of the priming process conferring release competence to insulin granules.},

It is well known that this fusion requires assembly of a SNARE protein complex. However, the timing of SNARE assembly relative to vesicle fusion--essential for understanding exocytosis--has not been demonstrated. To investigate this timing, we constructed a probe that detects the assembly of two plasma membrane SNAREs, SNAP25 and syntaxin-1A, through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). With two-photon imaging, we simultaneously measured FRET signals and insulin exocytosis in beta cells from the pancreatic islet of Langerhans. In some regions of the cell, we found that the SNARE complex was preassembled, which enabled rapid exocytosis. In other regions, SNARE assembly followed Ca(2+) influx, and exocytosis was slower. Thus, SNARE proteins exist in multiple stable preparatory configurations, from which Ca(2+) may trigger exocytosis through distinct mechanisms and with distinct kinetics.},

The loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells, in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively, put these cells at the center of the disease initiation and progression. Therefore, major efforts have been taken to restore the β-cell mass by cell-replacement or regeneration approaches. Implementing novel therapies requires deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate β-cells and determine the acquisition of their physiological phenotype. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the postnatal maturation of β-cells and define their functional identity. Furthermore, we discuss different routes by which β-cells lose their features and functionality in type 1 and 2 diabetic conditions. We then focus on potential mechanisms to restore the functionality of those β-cell populations that have lost their functional phenotype. Finally, we discuss the recent progress and remaining challenges facing the generation of functional mature β-cells from stem cells for cell-replacement therapy for diabetes treatment.},

	abstract = {Because tissue regeneration deteriorates with age, it is generally assumed that the younger the animal, the better it compensates for tissue damage. We have examined the effect of young age on compensatory proliferation of pancreatic β cells in vivo. Surprisingly, β cells in suckling mice fail to enter the cell division cycle in response to a diabetogenic injury or increased glycolysis. The potential of β cells for compensatory proliferation is acquired following premature weaning to normal chow, but not to a diet mimicking maternal milk. In addition, weaning coincides with enhanced glucose-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation and insulin secretion from islets. Transcriptome analysis reveals that weaning increases the expression of genes involved in replication licensing, suggesting a mechanism for increased responsiveness to the mitogenic activity of high glucose. We propose that weaning triggers a discrete maturation step of β cells, elevating both the mitogenic and secretory response to glucose.},

Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4), a non-Ca2+ binding paralog of the β cell Ca2+ sensor Syt7, increased by ∼8-fold during β cell maturation. Syt4 ablation increased basal insulin secretion and compromised GSIS. Precocious Syt4 expression repressed basal insulin secretion but also impaired islet morphogenesis and GSIS. Syt4 was localized on insulin granules and Syt4 levels inversely related to the number of readily releasable vesicles. Thus, transcriptional regulation of Syt4 affects insulin secretion; Syt4 expression is regulated in part by\&nbsp;Myt transcription factors, which repress Syt4 transcription. Finally, human SYT4 regulated GSIS in EndoC-βH1 cells, a human β cell line. These findings reveal the role that altered Ca2+ sensing plays in regulating β cell maturation.},

In this study, we addressed the potential contribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in pancreatic β cell development and maturation. We show that NPY expression is restricted from the progenitor populations during pancreatic development and marks functionally immature β cells in fetal and neonatal mice and humans. NPY expression is epigenetically downregulated in β cells upon maturation. Neonatal β cells that express NPY are more replicative, and knockdown of NPY expression in neonatal mouse islets reduces replication and enhances insulin secretion in response to high glucose. These data show that NPY expression likely promotes replication and contributes to impaired glucose responsiveness in neonatal β cells. We show that NPY expression reemerges in β cells in mice fed with high-fat diet as well as in diabetes in mice and humans, establishing a potential new mechanism to explain impaired β cell maturity in diabetes. Together, these studies highlight the contribution of NPY in the regulation of β cell differentiation and have potential applications for β cell supplementation for diabetes therapy.},

	abstract = {Paraphrasing the Swiss physician and father of toxicology Paracelsus (1493–1541) on chemical agents used as therapeutics, “the dose makes the poison,” it is now realized that this aptly applies to the calorigenic nutrients. The case here is the pancreatic islet β-cell presented with excessive levels of nutrients such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids. The short-term effects these nutrients exert on the β-cell are enhanced insulin biosynthesis and secretion and changes in glucose sensitivity. However, chronic fuel surfeit triggers additional compensatory and adaptive mechanisms by β-cells to cope with the increased insulin demand or to protect itself. When these mechanisms fail, toxicity due to the nutrient surplus ensues, leading to β-cell dysfunction, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis. The terms glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and glucolipotoxicity have been widely used, but there is some confusion as to what they mean precisely and which is most appropriate for a given situation. Here we address the gluco-, lipo-, and glucolipo-toxicities in β-cells by assessing the evidence both for and against each of them. We also discuss potential mechanisms and defend the view that many of the identified “toxic” effects of nutrient excess, which may also include amino acids, are in fact beneficial adaptive processes. In addition, candidate fuel-excess detoxification pathways are evaluated. Finally, we propose that a more general term should be used for the in vivo situation of overweight-associated type 2 diabetes reflecting both the adaptive and toxic processes to mixed calorigenic nutrients excess: “nutrient-induced metabolic stress” or, in brief, “nutri-stress.”},

The adrenal glands and gonads are an important part of the endocrine system, as they are the two main steroidogenic organs in mammals. They play a pivotal role in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis, metabolism, immunity, inflammation, stress response, and sexual development and reproduction. Surprisingly, the gonads and adrenal glands share functional characteristics, expressing many of the same enzymes required to catalyse steroid synthesis, and in both organs, steroidogenesis is regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary endocrine axis. These high similarities are explained by a common developmental origin, the adrenogonadal primordium (AGP), identified initially by the expression of Nr5a1, a specific marker of steroidogenic cells, in the coelomic epithelium. Hence, this primordium provides a unique model for studying cell fate decisions during mammalian morphogenesis. The small number of progenitor cells and the heterogeneity of cell types make emerging single cell technologies a preferred approach for investigations of cell differentiation by ensuring accurate characterisation of population diversity. Thus, we have generated a comprehensive atlas of the developing gonads and adrenals, using single cell time series transcriptomics. In this PhD thesis, I investigated cell fate decisions during steroidogenic cell differentiation in the developing adrenal cortex and gonads. First, I characterised the cellular identity of steroidogenic progenitor cells and described the molecular events involved during AGP formation, as well as during lineage specification leading to the separation of the adrenal and gonadal primordium. In the differentiated testis, I depicted the transcriptomic and functional differences between fetal and adult Leydig cells, which appear sequentially throughout life, and identified specific marker genes for both populations. In addition, I identified crucial differences in the regulation of steroidogenesis between fetal and adult Leydig cells. Finally, I investigated the fate of steroidogenic cells in the developing mouse adrenal cortex during the establishment of functional zones. This process, called zonation, results in the differentiation of steroidogenic cells, which are able to adopt a zona Glomerulosa or zona Fasciculata identity depending on their location in the cortex. Finally, the comprehensive atlas we have generated has allowed us to answer the preceding questions, but will also be a valuable resource for further studies. Thus, this atlas can improve the understanding of congenital diseases associated with adrenal and gonadal development.},

Flow cytometric monitoring of the cellular redox states indicated that islet B cells differ in their individual metabolic responsiveness to glucose. A shift from basal to increased NAD(P)H fluorescence occurred for 18\% of the cells at 1 mM glucose, for 43\% at 5 mM, and for 70\% at 20 mM. The functional significance of this metabolic heterogeneity was assessed by comparing protein synthesis in metabolically responsive and unresponsive subpopulations, shortly after their separation by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting. The glucose-sensitive subpopulation exhibited four- to fivefold higher rates of insulin synthesis during 60-min incubations at 2.5-10 mM glucose. Its higher biosynthetic activity was mainly caused by recruitment of cells into active synthesis and, to a lesser extent, by higher biosynthetic activity per recruited cell. Cells from the glucose-sensitive subpopulation were larger, and presented a threefold higher density of a pale secretory vesicle subtype, which is thought to contain unprocessed proinsulin. It is concluded that intercellular differences in metabolic responsiveness result in functional heterogeneity of the pancreatic B cell population.},

Under these conditions, a two-fold increase in NAD (P) H and a 40\% decrease in FAD was observed in more than 75\% of B-cells isolated from fed normal rats. The technique makes it possible to study the metabolic behaviour of the B-cell population in (physio)pathological conditions of impaired glucose-induced insulin release; the availability of functionally homogenous B-cell preparations facilitates studies on stimulus-secretion coupling.

In the past decade, high-throughput technologies have been developed to quantify gene expression in space, and computational methods have been developed that leverage spatial gene expression data to identify genes with spatial patterns and to delineate neighborhoods within tissues. To comprehensively document spatial gene expression technologies and data-analysis methods, we present a curated review of literature on spatial transcriptomics dating back to 1987, along with a thorough analysis of trends in the field, such as usage of experimental techniques, species, tissues studied, and computational approaches used. Our Review places current methods in a historical context, and we derive insights about the field that can guide current research strategies.

Until recently, transcript levels could only be quantified for a few genes in tissues, but advances in DNA sequencing, oligonucleotide synthesis and fluorescence microscopy have enabled the invention of a suite of spatial transcriptomics technologies capable of measuring the expression of many, or all, genes in situ. These technologies have evolved rapidly in sensitivity, multiplexing and throughput. As such, they have enabled the determination of the cell-type architecture of tissues, the querying of cell–cell interactions and the monitoring of molecular interactions between tissue components. The rapidly evolving spatial genomics landscape will enable generalized high-throughput genomic measurements and perturbations to be performed in the context of tissues.

	abstract = {This article proposes five stages in the progression of diabetes, each of which is characterized by different changes in β-cell mass, phenotype, and function. Stage 1 is compensation: insulin secretion increases to maintain normoglycemia in the face of insulin resistance and/or decreasing β-cell mass. This stage is characterized by maintenance of differentiated function with intact acute glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Stage 2 occurs when glucose levels start to rise, reaching ∼5.0–6.5 mmol/l; this is a stable state of β-cell adaptation with loss of β-cell mass and disruption of function as evidenced by diminished GSIS and β-cell dedifferentiation. Stage 3 is a transient unstable period of early decompensation in which glucose levels rise relatively rapidly to the frank diabetes of stage 4, which is characterized as stable decompensation with more severe β-cell dedifferentiation. Finally, stage 5 is characterized by severe decompensation representing a profound reduction in β-cell mass with progression to ketosis. Movement across stages 1–4 can be in either direction. For example, individuals with treated type 2 diabetes can move from stage 4 to stage 1 or stage 2. For type 1 diabetes, as remission develops, progression from stage 4 to stage 2 is typically found. Delineation of these stages provides insight into the pathophysiology of both progression and remission of diabetes.},

	abstract = {Paraphrasing the Swiss physician and father of toxicology Paracelsus (1493–1541) on chemical agents used as therapeutics, “the dose makes the poison,” it is now realized that this aptly applies to the calorigenic nutrients. The case here is the pancreatic islet β-cell presented with excessive levels of nutrients such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids. The short-term effects these nutrients exert on the β-cell are enhanced insulin biosynthesis and secretion and changes in glucose sensitivity. However, chronic fuel surfeit triggers additional compensatory and adaptive mechanisms by β-cells to cope with the increased insulin demand or to protect itself. When these mechanisms fail, toxicity due to the nutrient surplus ensues, leading to β-cell dysfunction, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis. The terms glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and glucolipotoxicity have been widely used, but there is some confusion as to what they mean precisely and which is most appropriate for a given situation. Here we address the gluco-, lipo-, and glucolipo-toxicities in β-cells by assessing the evidence both for and against each of them. We also discuss potential mechanisms and defend the view that many of the identified “toxic” effects of nutrient excess, which may also include amino acids, are in fact beneficial adaptive processes. In addition, candidate fuel-excess detoxification pathways are evaluated. Finally, we propose that a more general term should be used for the in vivo situation of overweight-associated type 2 diabetes reflecting both the adaptive and toxic processes to mixed calorigenic nutrients excess: “nutrient-induced metabolic stress” or, in brief, “nutri-stress.”},

	abstract = {Background
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in failure of blood glucose regulation and devastating secondary complications. Thus, β-cells are currently the prime target for cell-replacement and regenerative therapy. Triggering endogenous repair is a promising strategy to restore β-cell mass and normoglycemia in diabetic patients. Potential strategies include targeting specific β-cell subpopulations to increase proliferation or maturation. Alternatively, transdifferentiation of pancreatic islet cells (e.g. α- or δ-cells), extra-islet cells (acinar and ductal cells), hepatocytes, or intestinal cells into insulin-producing cells might improve glycemic control. To this end, it is crucial to systematically characterize and unravel the transcriptional program of all pancreatic cell types at the molecular level in homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, it is necessary to better determine the underlying mechanisms of β-cell maturation, maintenance, and dysfunction in diabetes, to identify and molecularly profile endocrine subpopulations with regenerative potential, and to translate the findings from mice to man. Recent approaches in single-cell biology started to illuminate heterogeneity and plasticity in the pancreas that might be targeted for β-cell regeneration in diabetic patients.

Scope of review
This review discusses recent literature on single-cell analysis including single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell mass cytometry, and flow cytometry of pancreatic cell types in the context of mechanisms of endogenous β-cell regeneration. We discuss new findings on the regulation of postnatal β-cell proliferation and maturation. We highlight how single-cell analysis recapitulates described principles of functional β-cell heterogeneity in animal models and adds new knowledge on the extent of β-cell heterogeneity in humans as well as its role in homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, we summarize the findings on cell subpopulations with regenerative potential that might enable the formation of new β-cells in diseased state. Finally, we review new data on the transcriptional program and function of rare pancreatic cell types and their implication in diabetes.

Major conclusion
Novel, single-cell technologies offer high molecular resolution of cellular heterogeneity within the pancreas and provide information on processes and factors that govern β-cell homeostasis, proliferation, and maturation. Eventually, these technologies might lead to the characterization of cells with regenerative potential and unravel disease-associated changes in gene expression to identify cellular and molecular targets for therapy.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic β-cells are prone to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to their role in insulin secretion. They require sustainable and efficient adaptive stress responses to cope with this stress. Whether episodes of chronic stress directly compromise β-cell identity is unknown. We show here under reversible, chronic stress conditions β-cells undergo transcriptional and translational reprogramming associated with impaired expression of regulators of β-cell function and identity. Upon recovery from stress, β-cells regain their identity and function, indicating a high degree of adaptive plasticity. Remarkably, while β-cells show resilience to episodic ER stress, when episodes exceed a threshold, β-cell identity is gradually lost. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of islets from type 1 diabetes patients indicates severe deregulation of the chronic stress-adaptation program and reveals novel biomarkers of diabetes progression. Our results suggest β-cell adaptive exhaustion contributes to diabetes pathogenesis., Pancreatic β-cells are naturally prone to ER stress due to their role in insulin production and secretion.

	abstract = {Transcriptionally mature and immature β-cells co-exist within the adult islet. How such diversity contributes to insulin release remains poorly understood. Here we show that subtle differences in β-cell maturity, defined using PDX1 and MAFA expression, contribute to islet operation. Functional mapping of rodent and human islets containing proportionally more PDX1HIGH and MAFAHIGH β-cells reveals defects in metabolism, ionic fluxes and insulin secretion. At the transcriptomic level, the presence of increased numbers of PDX1HIGH and MAFAHIGH β-cells leads to dysregulation of gene pathways involved in metabolic processes. Using a chemogenetic disruption strategy, differences in PDX1 and MAFA expression are shown to depend on islet Ca2+ signaling patterns. During metabolic stress, islet function can be restored by redressing the balance between PDX1 and MAFA levels across the β-cell population. Thus, preserving heterogeneity in PDX1 and MAFA expression, and more widely in β-cell maturity, might be important for the maintenance of islet function., Beta cell subpopulations with low expression in PDX1, MAFA, and insulin might contribute to islet function and insulin release.

However, these approaches were by design not intended to resolve heterogeneity between individual cells. Several recent studies used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to report considerable heterogeneity within mouse and human β-cells. In this Perspective, we assess how this newfound ability to assess gene expression at single-cell resolution has enhanced our understanding of β-cell heterogeneity. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of several single human β-cell transcriptome data sets and ask if the heterogeneity reported by these studies showed overlap and concurred with previously known examples of β-cell heterogeneity. We also illustrate the impact of the inevitable limitations of working at or below the limit of detection of gene expression at single cell resolution and their consequences for the quality of single–islet cell transcriptome data. Finally, we offer some guidance on when to opt for scRNA-Seq and when bulk sequencing approaches may be better suited.},

Cells obtained by mechanical dispersion of isolated rat islets of Langerhans were mixed with protein A-coated sheep red blood cells and incubated in the presence of an anti-insulin serum, under conditions known to affect insulin release. The cell mixture was further incubated with complement and finally fixed. Insulin release was revealed by the presence of hemolytic plaques which resulted from the complement-mediated lysis of red blood cells bearing insulin-anti-insulin complexes bound to protein A. Quantitation of hemolytic plaques around trypan blue-unstained and immunohistochemically identified B cells showed that stimulation of insulin release results in the recruitment of increasing numbers of secreting B cells as well as in the enhanced response of individual B cells. Reverse changes occur upon inhibition of insulin release. Comparison of freshly dispersed and one-day-cultured preparations did not reveal significant differences in the secretory response of undamaged B cells. In both preparations, single B cells responded to secretagogues in smaller proportions and to a lesser extent than clusters in which B cells had either maintained or restored contacts and junctional communication with their neighbours. However, the overall preponderant response of clusters was less than expected from the number of individually secreting B cells they contained. The data show that B cells are heterogeneous in terms of their ability to release insulin and provide evidence that cell-to-cell adhesion and/or junctional communication regulate hormone secretion from individual B cells.},

Several features of the islet vasculature (density and fenestration of the capillaries) ensure rapid exchange of nutrients and hormones, which is central to the islets' capacity to control of systemic metabolism via reciprocal changes of insulin and glucagon secretion. Here we discuss how changes in islet blood flow may underlie pulsatile insulin secretion, which becomes impaired in type-2 diabetes. Improved understanding of the architecture and regulation of pancreas/islet blood flow may therefore illuminate the causes underlying this common metabolic disorder. The pioneering work of August Krogh on blood flow, oxygen diffusion and capillary anatomy (that was awarded with the Nobel Prize in 1920) is a cornerstone in these efforts and remains relevant to today's research.},

Impaired insulin secretion results in the chronic hyperglycemia that characterizes type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which currently afflicts {\textgreater}450 million people worldwide. The healthy β-cell acts as a glucose sensor matching its output to the circulating glucose concentration. It does so via metabolically induced changes in electrical activity, which culminate in an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and initiation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the β-cell transcriptome, electrical activity, and insulin exocytosis. We highlight salient differences between mouse and human β-cells, provide models of how the different ion channels contribute to their electrical activity and insulin secretion, and conclude by discussing how these processes become perturbed in T2DM.},

	abstract = {Earlier experiments with the microsphere technique suggested that a heightened serum glucose concentration consistently leads to an increase in islet blood flow (IBF). Several lines of evidence suggest that this glucose-sensitive control mechanism is located at an extrapancreatic site. The purpose of this study was to define the possible role of the central nervous system in such a mechanism. D-glucose, L-glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, or saline were therefore infused into the carotid artery, each at a dose of 1 mg X kg body wt-1 X min-1 for 3 min, and the pancreatic and islet blood flows were measured. None of these substances affected the systemic serum glucose level. The intracarotid infusion of D-glucose, however, caused a rapid increase in both the serum insulin concentration and IBF. The blood flow to the whole pancreas nevertheless remained unchanged, indicating a redistribution of flow within the gland. Carotid infusion of the other test substances or a similar amount of D-glucose given in a femoral vein did not affect these parameters. Both the increase in serum insulin concentration and the increase in IBF caused by D-glucose could be abolished by vagotomy or administration of atropine. When the systemic blood glucose concentration was increased by intraperitoneal glucose administration (2 g/kg body wt), vagotomy blocked the increase in islet blood flow but not the concomitant insulin release. These observations suggest that the glucose-induced increase in IBF is mediated by vagal cholinergic influences.},

	abstract = {The cytoarchitecture of human islets has been examined, focusing on cellular associations that provide the anatomical framework for paracrine interactions. By using confocal microscopy and multiple immunofluorescence, we found that, contrary to descriptions of prototypical islets in textbooks and in the literature, human islets did not show anatomical subdivisions. Insulin-immunoreactive β cells, glucagon-immunoreactive α cells, and somatostatin-containing δ cells were found scattered throughout the human islet. Human β cells were not clustered, and most (71\%) showed associations with other endocrine cells, suggesting unique paracrine interactions in human islets. Human islets contained proportionally fewer β cells and more α cells than did mouse islets. In human islets, most β, α, and δ cells were aligned along blood vessels with no particular order or arrangement, indicating that islet microcirculation likely does not determine the order of paracrine interactions. We further investigated whether the unique human islet cytoarchitecture had functional implications. Applying imaging of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, we found that β cell oscillatory activity was not coordinated throughout the human islet as it was in mouse islets. Furthermore, human islets responded with an increase in [Ca2+]i when lowering the glucose concentration to 1 mM, which can be attributed to the large contribution of α cells to the islet composition. We conclude that the unique cellular arrangement of human islets has functional implications for islet cell function.},

The parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves innervate the pancreatic islet, but the precise innervation patterns are not known, particularly in human islets. Here we demonstrate that the innervation of human islets is different from that of mouse islets and that it does not conform to existing models of autonomic control of islet function. By visualizing axons in three dimensions and quantifying axonal densities and contacts within pancreatic islets, we found that, in contrast to mouse endocrine cells, human endocrine cells are sparsely contacted by autonomic axons. Few parasympathetic cholinergic axons penetrate the human islet and the invading sympathetic fibers preferentially innervate smooth muscle cells of blood vessels located within the islet. Thus, rather than modulating endocrine cell function directly, sympathetic nerves may regulate hormone secretion in human islets by controlling local blood flow or by acting on islet regions located downstream.},

The β-cell landscape of MIA reveals new cell states during disease progression and cross-publication differences between previously suggested marker genes. We show that β-cells in the streptozotocin model transcriptionally correlate with those in human type 2 diabetes and mouse db/db models, but are less similar to human type 1 diabetes and mouse NOD β-cells. We also report pathways that are shared between β-cells in immature, aged and diabetes models.

The new definition of NDM recently adopted, that includes patients with diabetes onset within 6 months of age, has prompted studies that have set the incidence of the permanent form alone between 1:210,000 and 1:260,000 live births. Aim of the present work was to ascertain the incidence of NDM (i.e. permanent + transient form) in Italy for years 2005-2010. Patients referred to the Italian reference laboratory for NDM between years 2005 and 2010 and screened for mutations in common NDM genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS) and for uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (UDP6) were reviewed. A questionnaire aimed at identifying NDM cases investigated in other laboratories was sent to 54 Italian reference centers for pediatric diabetes. Twenty-seven patients with NDM born between 2005 and 2010 were referred to the reference laboratory. In this group, a mutation of either KCNJ11, ABCC8 or INS was found in 18 patients, and a case with UDP6 was identified. Questionnaires revealed 4 additional cases with transient neonatal diabetes due to UDP6. Incidence of NDM was calculated at 1:90,000 (CI: 1:63,000-1:132,000) live births. Thus, with the definition currently in use, about 6 new cases with NDM are expected to be born in Italy each year.},

	abstract = {Transient (TNDM) and Permanent (PNDM) Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus are rare conditions occurring in 1:300,000–400,000 live births. TNDM infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life but go into remission in a few months, with possible relapse to a permanent diabetes state usually around adolescence or as adults. The pancreatic dysfunction in this condition may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period and does not go into remission. Patients with TNDM are more likely to have intrauterine growth retardation and less likely to develop ketoacidosis than patients with PNDM. In TNDM, patients are younger at the diagnosis of diabetes and have lower initial insulin requirements. Considerable overlap occurs between the two groups, so that TNDM cannot be distinguished from PNDM based on clinical features. Very early onset diabetes mellitus seems to be unrelated to autoimmunity in most instances. A number of conditions are associated with PNDM, some of which have been elucidated at the molecular level. Among these, the very recently elucidated mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunit of the pancreatic KATP channel involved in regulation of insulin secretion, account for one third to half of the PNDM cases. Molecular analysis of chromosome 6 anomalies (found in more than 60\% in TNDM), and the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1, provides a tool to identify TNDM from PNDM in the neonatal period. This analysis also has potentially important therapeutic consequences leading to transfer some patients, those with mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas. Recurrent diabetes is common in patients with "transient" neonatal diabetes mellitus and, consequently, prolonged follow-up is imperative. Realizing how difficult it is to take care of a child of this age with diabetes mellitus should prompt clinicians to transfer these children to specialized centers. Insulin therapy and high caloric intake are the basis of the treatment. Insulin pump may offer an interesting therapeutic tool in this age group in experienced hands.},

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells located in the endocrine pancreas in areas known as islets of Langerhans. The current standard-of-care for T1D is exogenous insulin replacement therapy. Recent developments in this field include the hybrid closed-loop system for regulated insulin delivery and long-acting insulins. Clinical studies on prediction and prevention of diabetes-associated complications have demonstrated the importance of early treatment and glucose control for reducing the risk of developing diabetic complications. Transplantation of primary islets offers an effective approach for treating patients with T1D. However, this strategy is hampered by challenges such as the limited availability of islets, extensive death of islet cells, and poor vascular engraftment of islets post-transplantation. Accordingly, there are considerable efforts currently underway for enhancing islet transplantation efficiency by harnessing the beneficial actions of stem cells. This review will provide an overview of currently available therapeutic options for T1D, and discuss the growing evidence that supports the use of stem cell approaches to enhance therapeutic outcomes.},

Mice engineered to express an MCP-1 transgene in adipose tissue under the control of the aP2 gene promoter exhibited insulin resistance, macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue, and increased hepatic triglyceride content. Furthermore, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet were reduced extensively in MCP-1 homozygous KO mice compared with WT animals. Finally, acute expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MCP-1 ameliorated insulin resistance in db/db mice and in WT mice fed a high-fat diet. These findings suggest that an increase in MCP-1 expression in adipose tissue contributes to the macrophage infiltration into this tissue, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis associated with obesity in mice.},

	abstract = {Obesity is highly associated with insulin resistance and is the biggest risk factor for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The molecular basis of this common syndrome, however, is poorly understood. It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals. To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha. The absence of TNF-alpha resulted in significantly improved insulin sensitivity in both diet-induced obesity and that resulting for the ob/ob model of obesity. The TNFalpha-deficient obese mice had lower levels of circulating free fatty acids, and were protected from the obesity-related reduction in the insulin receptor signalling in muscle and fat tissues. These results indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin action.},

	abstract = {We review evidence that increased tissue levels of fatty acyl CoA cause the beta-cell abnormalities of nondiabetic obesity and ultimately result in obesity-dependent diabetes. Nondiabetic obesity in Zucker rats is characterized by hypersecretion of insulin at normal fasting and subfasting glucose concentrations. This is a result of beta-cell hyperplasia and increased low Km glucose usage and oxidation. These abnormalities, the hyperinsulinemia, the hyperplasia of beta-cells, i.e., its in vitro equivalent, enhanced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and the increased low Km glucose usage can be induced by culturing normal islets with 2 mmol/l free fatty acids (FFAs). Once obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats become diabetic, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is absent and beta-cell GLUT2 reduced. Islet triglyceride (TG) content is increased 10-fold, probably reflecting increased FFA delivery (plasma FFA levels {\textgreater} 1.5 mmol/l) beginning about 2 weeks before the onset of diabetes. These beta-cell abnormalities, GSIS loss, GLUT2 loss, and TG accumulation, are prevented by reducing plasma FFAs by caloric restriction and by nicotinamide injection. The loss of GSIS and the accumulation of TGs, but not the GLUT2 loss, can be induced in vitro in normal islets cultured in a 2 mmol/l FFA-containing medium, but prediabetic islets seem far more vulnerable to FFA-induced functional impairment and TG accumulation. It is proposed that in uncomplicated obesity, increased lipid availability (FFA levels {\textless} 1.5 mmol/l) induces both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in parallel fashion, thereby maintaining normoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Defects in the function and mass of β-cells play a significant role in the development and progression of diabetes. Increased β-cell deficiency and β-cell apoptosis are observed in the pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes. At an early stage, β-cells adapt to insulin resistance, and their insulin secretion increases, but they eventually become exhausted, and the β-cell mass decreases. Various causal factors, such as high glucose, free fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, and islet amyloid polypeptides, contribute to the impairment of β-cell function. Therefore, the maintenance of β-cell function is a logical approach for the treatment and prevention of diabetes. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of these risk factors in pancreatic β-cell loss and the associated mechanisms. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic β-cell loss will provide an opportunity to identify novel therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.},

Despite the availability of many antidiabetes agents and pharmacotherapies targeting cardiovascular risk factors, the morbidity, mortality and economic consequences of T2DM are still a great burden to patients, society, health care systems and the economy. The need for new therapies for glycaemic control is compounded by the fact that existing treatments have limitations either because of their side effects (particularly weight gain and hypoglycaemia) or contraindications that limit their use. Furthermore, none of the current therapies have a significant impact on disease progression. Incretin-based therapies offer a new therapeutic approach to the management of T2DM, and there are also several even newer therapies in development. There are two groups of incretin-based therapies currently available; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues/mimetics. The former are given orally while the latter subcutaneously. These drugs result in glucose-dependent insulin secretion and glucose-dependent glucagon suppression, with consequent low risk of hypoglycaemia when used as mono- or combination therapy (except when used with sulphonylureas). In addition, they are either weight neutral in the case of DPP-4 inhibitors or cause weight loss in the case of incretin mimetics/analogues. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that these agents prolong beta cell survival which offers the theoretical possibility of slowing the progression to T2DM. In this article we will review the currently available antidiabetes agents with particular emphasis on incretin-based and future therapies. In addition, we will review and discuss the evidence relating to glycaemic control and cardiovascular disease.},

Surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are complex and are still not fully understood. Early evidence highlighted the liver as the major organ involved in the effect of metformin on reducing blood levels of glucose. However, increasing evidence points towards other sites of action that might also have an important role, including the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbial communities and the tissue-resident immune cells. At the molecular level, it seems that the mechanisms of action vary depending on the dose of metformin used and duration of treatment. Initial studies have shown that metformin targets hepatic mitochondria; however, the identification of a novel target at low concentrations of metformin at the lysosome surface might reveal a new mechanism of action. Based on the efficacy and safety records in T2DM, attention has been given to the repurposing of metformin as part of adjunct therapy for the treatment of cancer, age-related diseases, inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of metformin and discuss potential emerging novel therapeutic uses.},

	abstract = {While there are various kinds of drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus at present, in this review article, we focus on metformin which is an insulin sensitizer and is often used as a first-choice drug worldwide. Metformin mainly activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver which leads to suppression of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Metformin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle as well, which increases translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane and thereby increases glucose uptake. Further, metformin suppresses glucagon signaling in the liver by suppressing adenylate cyclase which leads to suppression of gluconeogenesis. In addition, metformin reduces autophagy failure observed in pancreatic β-cells under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, it is known that metformin alters the gut microbiome and facilitates the transport of glucose from the circulation into excrement. It is also known that metformin reduces food intake and lowers body weight by increasing circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Furthermore, much attention has been drawn to the fact that the frequency of various cancers is lower in subjects taking metformin. Metformin suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by activating AMPK in pre-neoplastic cells, which leads to suppression of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis in pre-neoplastic cells. It has been shown recently that metformin consumption potentially influences the mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). Taken together, metformin is an old drug, but multifaceted mechanisms of action of metformin have been unraveled one after another in its long history.},

	abstract = {As the heterogeneity of diabetes is becoming increasingly clear, opportunities arise for more accurate assessment of factors influencing disease onset, which may lead to more efficient primary prevention. LADA – latent autoimmune diabetes in adults – is a common, hybrid form of diabetes with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiological and etiological overlap and differences between LADA and type 2 diabetes, discuss similarities between LADA and type 1 diabetes and point at future research needs. Studies conducted to date show a clear genetic overlap between LADA and type 1 diabetes with a high risk conferred by variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. In contrast, data from the limited number of studies on lifestyle factors available indicate that LADA may share several environmental risk factors with type 2 diabetes including overweight, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption (protective) and smoking. These factors are known to influence insulin sensitivity, suggesting that insulin resistance, in addition to insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of the beta cells, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of LADA. Moreover, this implies that onset of LADA, similar to type 2 diabetes, to some extent could be prevented or postponed by lifestyle modification such as weight reduction and increased physical activity. The preventive potential of LADA is an important topic to elucidate in future studies, preferably intervention studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
We studied differences between patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 2 diabetes, and classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after age 35 years.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1, INS, PTPN22, and CTLA4 were genotyped in patients with LADA (n = 213), type 1 diabetes diagnosed at {\textgreater}35 years of age (T1D{\textgreater}35y; n = 257) or {\textless}20 years of age (T1D{\textless}20y; n = 158), and type 2 diabetes.

RESULTS
Although patients with LADA had an increased frequency of HLA-DQB1 and PTPN22 risk genotypes and alleles compared with type 2 diabetic subjects, the frequency was significantly lower compared with T1D{\textgreater}35y patients. Genotype frequencies, measures of insulin secretion, and metabolic traits within LADA differed according to GAD antibody (GADA) quartiles, but even the highest quartile differed from type 1 diabetes. Having two or more risk genotypes was associated with lower C-peptide concentrations in LADA.

CONCLUSIONS
LADA patients differed genetically and phenotypically from both T1D{\textgreater}35y and type 2 diabetic patients in a manner dependent on GADA levels.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE—Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is often considered a slowly progressing subtype of type 1 diabetes, although the clinical picture more resembles type 2 diabetes. One way to improve classification is to study whether LADA shares genetic features with type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—To accomplish this, we studied whether LADA shares variation in the HLA locus or INS VNTR and PTPN22 genes with type 1 diabetes or the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes in 361 LADA, 718 type 1 diabetic, and 1,676 type 2 diabetic patients, as well as 1,704 healthy control subjects from Sweden and Finland.RESULTS—LADA subjects showed, compared with type 2 diabetic patients, increased frequency of risk for the HLA-DQB1 *0201/*0302 genotype (27 vs. 6.9\%; P \&lt; 1 × 10−6), with similar frequency as with type 1 diabetes (36\%). In addition, LADA subjects showed higher frequencies of protective HLA-DQB1 *0602(3)/X than type 1 diabetic patients (8.1 vs. 3.2\%, P = 0.003). The AA genotype of rs689, referring to the class I allele in the INS VNTR, as well as the CT/TT genotypes of rs2476601 in the PTPN22 gene, were increased both in type 1 diabetic (P = 3 × 10−14 and P = 1 × 10−10, respectively) and LADA (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002) subjects compared with control subjects. Notably, the frequency of the type 2 diabetes–associated CT/TT genotypes of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 were increased in LADA subjects (52.8\%; P = 0.03), to the same extent as in type 2 diabetic subjects (54.1\%, P = 3 × 10−7), compared with control subjects (44.8\%) and type 1 diabetic subjects (43.3\%).CONCLUSIONS—LADA shares genetic features with both type 1 (HLA, INS VNTR, and PTPN22) and type 2 (TCF7L2) diabetes, which justifies considering LADA as an admixture of the two major types of diabetes.},
