	abstract = {With the rising number of individuals affected with diabetes and the significant health care costs of treatment, the emphasis on prevention is key to controlling the health burden of this disease. Several genetic and genomic studies have identified genetic variants associated with increased risk to diabetes. As a result, commercial testing is available to predict an individual's genetic risk. Although the clinical benefits of testing have not yet been demonstrated, it is worth considering some of the ethical implications of testing for this common chronic disease. In this article, I discuss several issues that should be considered during the translation of predictive testing for diabetes, including familial implications, improvement of risk communication, implications for behavioral change and health outcomes, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, direct-to-consumer testing, and appropriate age of testing.},

This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

	abstract = {The increase in the prevalence of obesity represents a worldwide phenomenon in all age groups and is pathologically and genetically correlated with several metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, representing the most frequent age-related diseases. Obesity superimposed on aging drastically increases chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), which is an important link between obesity, insulin resistance, and age-associated diseases. Immune cells of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems infiltrate the adipose tissue (AT) and during obesity induce inflammatory responses associated with metabolic switches and changes in phenotypes and function of immune cell subsets. Obesity poses new health problems especially when it occurs in the context of other diseases, many of them frequently affect elderly subjects. An emerging problem is the decreased proportion of patients with obesity achieving clinical response to therapy. In this review, we will discuss the reciprocal influences of immune cell and AT inflammation in aging and age-associated diseases and the complex relationship of nutrient and energy-sensing homeostatic checkpoints, which contribute to shape the phenotype of the AT. We will specifically examine type-2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cognitive impairment, and dementia, where obesity plays a significant role, also in shaping some clinical aspects.},

	abstract = {Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation, which contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Under normal conditions, skeletal muscle is responsible for the majority of insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal; thus, dysregulation of skeletal muscle metabolism can strongly influence whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation occurs in skeletal muscle in obesity and is mainly manifested by increased immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory activation in intermyocellular and perimuscular adipose tissue. By secreting proinflammatory molecules, immune cells may induce myocyte inflammation, adversely regulate myocyte metabolism, and contribute to insulin resistance via paracrine effects. Increased influx of fatty acids and inflammatory molecules from other tissues, particularly visceral adipose tissue, can also induce muscle inflammation and negatively regulate myocyte metabolism, leading to insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {Glucose stimulation of insulin release involves closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, depolarization, and Ca2+ influx in B cells. Mouse islets were used to investigate whether glucose can still regulate insulin release when it cannot control ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Opening of these channels by diazoxide (100-250 mumol/liter) blocked the effects of glucose on B cell membrane potential (intracellular microelectrodes), free cytosolic Ca2+ (fura-2 method), and insulin release, but it did not prevent those of high K (30 mmol/liter). K-induced insulin release in the presence of diazoxide was, however, dose dependently increased by glucose, which was already effective at concentrations (2-6 mmol/liter) that are subthreshold under normal conditions (low K and no diazoxide). This effect was not accompanied by detectable changes in B cell membrane potential. Measurements of 45Ca fluxes and cytosolic Ca2+ indicated that glucose slightly increased Ca2+ influx during the first minutes of depolarization by K, but not in the steady state when its effect on insulin release was the largest. In conclusion, there exists a mechanism by which glucose can control insulin release independently from changes in K(+)-ATP channel activity, in membrane potential, and in cytosolic Ca2+. This mechanism may serve to amplify the secretory response to the triggering signal (closure of K(+)-ATP channels--depolarization--Ca2+ influx) induced by glucose.},

	abstract = {Background : The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods : We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results : We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions : This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess β-cell function preservation after 3.5 years of intensive therapy with insulin plus metformin (INS group) versus triple oral therapy (TOT group) with metformin, glyburide, and pioglitazone.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized trial of 58 patients with treatment-naïve newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. All patients were treated with insulin and metformin for a 3-month lead-in period followed by random assignment to the INS or TOT group. β-Cell function was assessed using a mixed-meal challenge test at randomization and 6, 12, 18, 30, and 42 months. Analyses were intention to treat and performed with repeated-measures models.
RESULTS: Completion rates at 3.5 years were 83\% in the insulin group and 72\% in the TOT group, with good compliance in both groups (87 ± 20\% in the INS group vs. 90 ± 15\% in the TOT group). β-Cell function was preserved at 3.5 years after diagnosis, with no significant change from baseline or difference between the two groups as measured by area under the curve (AUC) of C-peptide (P = 0.14) or the ratio of C-peptide to glucose AUC (P = 0.7). Excellent glycemic control was maintained in both groups (end-of-study HbA(1c) 6.35 ± 0.84\% in the INS group vs. 6.59 ± 1.94\% in the TOT group). Weight increased in both groups over time (from 102.2 ± 24.9 kg to 106.2 ± 31.7 kg in the INS group and from 100.9 ± 23.0 kg to 110.5 ± 31.8 kg in the TOT group), with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.35). Hypoglycemic events decreased significantly over time (P = 0.01) but did not differ between groups (P = 0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: β-Cell function can be preserved for at least 3.5 years with early and intensive therapy for type 2 diabetes with either insulin plus metformin or triple oral therapy after an initial 3-month insulin-based treatment period.},

A mouse model of insulin-secretory deficiency induced by β cell inexcitability (K(ATP) gain of function) demonstrates development of diabetes and reiterates the features of human neonatal diabetes. In the diabetic state, β cells lose their mature identity and dedifferentiate to neurogenin3-positive and insulin-negative cells. Lineage-tracing experiments show that dedifferentiated cells can subsequently redifferentiate to mature neurogenin3-negative, insulin-positive β cells after lowering of blood glucose by insulin therapy. We demonstrate here that β cell dedifferentiation, rather than apoptosis, is the main mechanism of loss of insulin-positive cells, and redifferentiation accounts for restoration of insulin content and antidiabetic drug responsivity in these animals. These results may help explain gradual decrease in β cell mass in long-standing diabetes and recovery of β cell function and drug responsivity in type 2 diabetic patients following insulin therapy, and they suggest an approach to rescuing "exhausted" β cells in diabetes.},

Among several cellular biological mechanisms of cellular dysfunction, we and others have recently proposed that dedifferentiation of β-cells can explain the slowly progressive onset and partial reversibility of β-cell failure. Accordingly, we provided evidence of such processes in humans and experimental animal models of insulin-resistant diabetes. In this study, we asked whether β-cell dedifferentiation can be prevented with diet or pharmacological treatment of diabetes. db/db mice, a widely used model of insulin-resistant diabetes and obesity, were either pair fed or treated with the Sglt inhibitor phloridzin, the insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone, or insulin. All treatments were equally efficacious in reducing plasma glucose levels. Pair feeding and phloridzin also resulted in significant weight loss. However, pair feeding among the four treatments resulted in a reduction of β-cell dedifferentiation, as assessed by Foxo1 and Aldh1a3 immunohistochemistry. The effect of diet to partly restore β-cell function is consistent with data in human diabetes and provides another potential mechanism by which lifestyle changes act as an effective intervention against diabetes progression.},

	abstract = {The delivery of nutrients to the gastrointestinal tract after food ingestion activates the secretion of several gut-derived mediators, including the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), such as exenatide and liraglutide, are currently employed successfully in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. GLP-1RA improve glycaemic control and stimulate satiety, leading to reductions in food intake and body weight. Besides gastric distension and peripheral vagal nerve activation, GLP-1RA induce satiety by influencing brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, and several routes of action have been proposed. This review summarises the evidence for a physiological role of GLP-1 in the central regulation of feeding behaviour and the different routes of action involved. Also, we provide an overview of presently available data on pharmacological stimulation of GLP-1 pathways leading to alterations in CNS activity, reductions in food intake and weight loss.},

	abstract = {The pandemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been largely attributed to the increasing prevalence of worldwide obesity at a geometric rate. However, the number of non-obese patients with T2DM is also on the rise, and it is as high as 60-80\% in some Asian countries. These non-obese individuals have certain peculiarities and have a higher mortality rate compared with obese individuals. The pathophysiology of T2DM in non-obese individuals remains poorly understood, and this has an impact on defining its management. This review discusses the current understanding of the pathophysiology of T2DM in non-obese individuals. The definition of T2DM in non-obese individuals remains controversial because of the limited clinical measurements, and the current definition of obesity using body mass index (BMI) is not very helpful as these individuals have BMIs of {\textless}25K g/m3, which is considered normal. Many authors have argued that the so-called non-obese people are actually metabolically obese; however, in terms of the measurements clinically available, they are non-obese. The simplistic understanding of the mechanism of the pathophysiology sees it in terms of the balance between insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The pathogenesis of insulin resistance in a lean patient has been proven to be the same as what is seen in an obese individual, but most studies confirm more severe functional insulin secretory defects in lean individuals compared to the obese phenotype. The mechanism underlying this form of T2DM is still poorly defined, and more research is required to understand the mechanism of sarcopenic obesity, which some studies have revealed.},

	abstract = {A major reason for the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across the world is the so-called obesity epidemic, which occurs both in developed and developing countries. However, a large proportion of patients with T2DM in European and, in particular, Asian countries are non-obese. The non-obese T2DM phenotype is characterized by disproportionally reduced insulin secretion and less insulin resistance, as compared with obese patients with T2DM. Importantly, non-obese patients with T2DM have a similar increased risk of cardiovascular disease as obese T2DM patients. The risk of T2DM in non-obese patients is influenced by genetics as well as factors operating in utero indicated by low birth weight. Furthermore, this phenotype is slightly more prevalent among patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, characterized by positive anti-GAD antibodies. The recently identified TCF7L2 gene polymorphism resulting in low insulin secretion influences the risk of T2DM in both obese and non-obese subjects, but is relatively more prevalent among non-obese patients with T2DM. Furthermore, the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR gamma gene influencing insulin action increases the risk of T2DM in non-obese subjects. Despite a "normal" body mass index, non-obese patients with T2DM are generally characterized by a higher degree of both abdominal and total fat masses (adiposity). Prevention of T2DM with lifestyle intervention is at least as effective in non-obese as in obese prediabetic subjects, and recent data suggest that metformin treatment targeting insulin resistance and non-glycemic cardiovascular disease risk factors is as beneficial in non-obese as in obese patients with T2DM. Nevertheless, non-obese patients with T2DM may progress to insulin treatment more rapidly as compared with obese patients with T2DM.},

	abstract = {In obesity and type 2 diabetes, expression of the GLUT4 glucose transporter is decreased selectively in adipocytes. Adipose-specific Glut4 (also known as Slc2a4) knockout (adipose-Glut4(-/-)) mice show insulin resistance secondarily in muscle and liver. Here we show, using DNA arrays, that expression of retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) is elevated in adipose tissue of adipose-Glut4(-/-) mice. We show that serum RBP4 levels are elevated in insulin-resistant mice and humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. RBP4 levels are normalized by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug. Transgenic overexpression of human RBP4 or injection of recombinant RBP4 in normal mice causes insulin resistance. Conversely, genetic deletion of Rbp4 enhances insulin sensitivity. Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that increases urinary excretion of RBP4, normalizes serum RBP4 levels and improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Increasing serum RBP4 induces hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and impairs insulin signalling in muscle. Thus, RBP4 is an adipocyte-derived 'signal' that may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Lowering RBP4 could be a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.},

The number of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3-positive/hormone-negative cells was 3-fold higher in diabetics compared with controls. Moreover, β-cell-specific transcription factors were ectopically found in glucagon- and somatostatin-producing cells of diabetic subjects.The data support the view that pancreatic β-cells become dedifferentiated and convert to α- and δ-“like” cells in human type 2 diabetes. The findings should prompt a reassessment of goals in the prevention and treatment of β-cell dysfunction.},

The identification of pathways involved in dedifferentiation may provide clues to its reversal. Here we isolate and functionally characterize failing β cells from various experimental models of diabetes and report a striking enrichment in the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 isoform A3 (ALDH+) as β cells become dedifferentiated. Flow-sorted ALDH+ islet cells demonstrate impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, are depleted of Foxo1 and MafA, and include a Neurogenin3-positive subset. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrates that ALDH+ cells are characterized by: (i) impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial complex I, IV and V; (ii) activated RICTOR; and (iii) progenitor cell markers. We propose that impaired mitochondrial function marks the progression from metabolic inflexibility to dedifferentiation in the natural history of β-cell failure.},

Synthetic rates, pathway (direct versus indirect) contributions, and percent turnover of hepatic glycogen were assessed by in vivo 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy during [1-13C]glucose infusion followed by a natural abundance glucose chase in conjunction with acetaminophen to noninvasively sample the hepatic UDP-glucose pool. In the presence of hyperglycemia (10.4 +/- 0.1 mM) and basal portal vein insulinemia (192 +/- 6 pM), suppression of glucagon secretion (plasma glucagon, I:31 +/- 4, II: 63 +/- 8 pg/ml) doubled the hepatic accumulation of glycogen (Vsyn) compared with conditions of basal glucagonemia [I: 0.40 +/- 0.06, II: 0.19 +/- 0.03 mumol/(liter.min): P {\textless} 0.0025]. Glycogen turnover was markedly reduced (I: 19 +/- 7\%, II: 69 +/- 12\%; P {\textless} 0.005), so that net rate of glycogen synthesis increased approximately fivefold (P {\textless} 0.001) by inhibition of glucagon secretion. The relative contribution of gluconeogenesis (indirect pathway) to glycogen synthesis was lower during hypoglucagonemia (42 +/- 6\%) than during basal glucagonemia (54 +/- 5\%; P {\textless} 0.005). Under conditions of basal peripheral insulinemia (54 +/- 2 pM) and hypoglucagonemia (III) there was negligible hepatic glycogen synthesis and turnover. In conclusion, small changes in portal vein concentrations of insulin and glucagon independently affect hepatic glycogen synthesis and turnover. Inhibition of glucagon secretion under conditions of hyperglycemia and basal concentrations of insulin results in: (a) twofold increase in rate of hepatic glycogen synthesis, (b) reduction of glycogen turnover by approximately 73\%, and (c) augmented percent contribution of the direct pathway to glycogen synthesis compared with conditions of basal glucagonemia.},

High mobility group-box 3 (HMGB3) has been shown to affect tumor initiation and progression. This research aimed to investigate the role of HMGB3 in gastric cancer (GC) cell proliferation, migration, invasion, chemoresistance, and its potential molecular mechanisms.

Material/Methods
GC MGC803 and BGC823 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting the HMGB3 gene. The expressions of HMGB3 protein in MGC803 and BGC823 cells after transfection were detected by Western blot assays. We detected cell proliferation and cell cycle by MTT and flow cytometry assay. Cell migration and invasion were determined by wound scratch and transwell assay. MGC803 and BGC823 cells were treated with various concentrations of oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. After 24 hours of drug exposure, we performed MTT assays to investigate chemoresistance in both groups. Western blot assays were used to detect related proteins expression.

Results
Silencing of HMGB3 inhibited cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 phase arrest of GC cells partly via modulating p53 and p21 pathways, and downregulating Bcl-2/Bax ratio. RNA interference of HMGB3 inhibited cell invasion and migration by downregulating MMP2 and MMP9. Silencing of HMGB3 enhanced sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel, and reduced sensitive to oxaliplatin.

Conclusions
These findings suggest the importance of HMGB3 in the regulation of growth, migration, and apoptosis of GC, improve our understanding of the mechanisms of GC pathogenesis, and may promote the development of novel targeted therapies.},

We observed that long-term repopulating ability is entirely contained in the subpopulation of Lin–, c-kitHI cells that express Hmgb3. Most common lymphoid and myeloid progenitors express Hmgb3. Introduction of a retrovirus containing the Hmgb3 cDNA into mouse bone marrow stem cells demonstrated that enforced expression of Hmgb3 inhibited B-cell and myeloid differentiation. We conclude that down-regulation of Hmgb3 protein levels is an important step for myeloid and B-cell differentiation.},

	abstract = {HMGB1, an evolutionarily conserved chromosomal protein, was recently re-discovered to act as a “danger signal” (alarmin) to alert the innate immune system for the initiation of host defense or tissue repair. Extracellular HMGB1 can be either passively released from damaged/necrotic cells or secreted by activated immune cells. Upon stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells secrete high levels of HMGB1 into the intercellular milieu. HMGB1 is potent to target DCs, macrophages, neutrophils and CD4+ T cells. It also upregulates the expression of BCL-XL by which it may prevent the elimination of activated immune cells. As a result, HMGB1 has been suggested to be implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Given the similarities of autoimmune response against beta cell self-antigens in type 1 diabetes (T1D), in this view we will discuss the possible implications of HMGB1 in T1D pathogenesis. Specifically, we will summarize and update the advancement of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune initiation and progression duringT1D development, as well as islet allograft rejection of diabetic patients after islet transplantation. Elucidation of the role for HMGB1 in T1D pathogenesis would not only enhance the understanding of disease etiology, but also have the potential to shed new insight into the development of therapeutic strategies for prevention or intervention of this disorder.},

	volume = {3},
	issn = {1549-1676},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.0030017},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are at least two phases of beta-cell death during the development of autoimmune diabetes: an initiation event that results in the release of beta-cell-specific antigens, and a second, antigen-driven event in which beta-cell death is mediated by the actions of T lymphocytes. In this report, the mechanisms by which the macrophage-derived cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 induces beta-cell death are examined. IL-1, known to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion by stimulating inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and increased production of nitric oxide by beta-cells, also induces beta-cell death.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: To ascertain the mechanisms of cell death, the effects of IL-1 and known activators of apoptosis on beta-cell viability were examined. While IL-1 stimulates beta-cell DNA damage, this cytokine fails to activate caspase-3 or to induce phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization; however, apoptosis inducers activate caspase-3 and the externalization of PS on beta-cells. In contrast, IL-1 stimulates the release of the immunological adjuvant high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1; a biochemical maker of necrosis) in a nitric oxide-dependent manner, while apoptosis inducers fail to stimulate HMGB1 release. The release of HMGB1 by beta-cells treated with IL-1 is not sensitive to caspase-3 inhibition, while inhibition of this caspase attenuates beta-cell death in response to known inducers of apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that IL-1 induces beta-cell necrosis and support the hypothesis that macrophage-derived cytokines may participate in the initial stages of diabetes development by inducing beta-cell death by a mechanism that promotes antigen release (necrosis) and islet inflammation (HMGB1 release).},

	abstract = {Immediate-early genes (IEGs) can be activated and transcribed within minutes after stimulation, without the need for de novo protein synthesis, and they are stimulated in response to both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic signals. Extracellular signals are transduced from the cell surface, through receptors activating a chain of proteins in the cell, in particular extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and members of the RhoA-actin pathway. These communicate through a signaling cascade by adding phosphate groups to neighboring proteins, and this will eventually activate and translocate TFs to the nucleus and thereby induce gene expression. The gene activation also involves proximal and distal enhancers that interact with promoters to simulate gene expression. The immediate-early genes have essential biological roles, in particular in stress response, like the immune system, and in differentiation. Therefore they also have important roles in various diseases, including cancer development. In this paper we summarize some recent advances on key aspects of the activation and regulation of immediate-early genes.},

Here, we investigated the intracellular signaling pathway following stimulation of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels and addressed the function of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) in pancreatic β-cells of transgenic mice. Stimulation of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels activates AP-1 in insulinoma cells. Pharmacological and genetic experiments identified c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase as a signal transducer connecting Cav1.2 Ca2+ channel activation with gene transcription. Moreover, the basic region-leucine zipper proteins ATF2 and c-Jun or c-Jun-related proteins were involved in stimulus-transcription coupling. We addressed the functions of AP-1 in pancreatic β-cells analyzing a newly generated transgenic mouse model. These transgenic mice expressed A-Fos, a mutant of c-Fos that attenuates DNA binding of c-Fos dimerization partners. In insulinoma cells, A-Fos completely blocked AP-1 activation following stimulation of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels. The analysis of transgenic A-Fos-expressing mice revealed that the animals displayed impaired glucose tolerance. Thus, we show here for the first time that AP-1 controls an important function of pancreatic β-cells in vivo, the regulation of glucose homeostasis.},

Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism by which an adaptive increase in β-cell mass occurs in vivo will lead to the development of a cure for diabetes. Insulin and insulin receptor (IR)-mediated signaling pathways play an important role in the mechanism that increases β-cell mass by compensatory β-cell proliferation in response to chronic insulin resistance. However, whether IR is required for compensatory β-cell proliferation remains controversial in some situations. It might be possible that IR acts as a scaffold for the signaling complex independent of its ligand. It has also been reported that the forkhead box protein M1/polo-like kinase 1/centromere protein A pathway plays a central role in adaptive β-cell proliferation during diet-induced obesity, hyperglycemia, pregnancy, aging and acute insulin resistance. We recently reported that the cross-talk of islets with fat tissue, in addition to the liver, through humoral factors is involved in adaptive β-cell proliferation. This accommodative response of β-cell proliferation through adipocytes was observed particularly under an acute insulin resistance state in an IR/insulin signal-independent and forkhead box protein M1/polo-like kinase 1/centromere protein A pathway-dependent manner. A remaining barrier for the treatment of human diabetes using β-cells is the differences between human and rodent islets. In this review, the focus is on signaling pathways that regulate adaptive β-cell proliferation for the treatment of diabetes considering the abovementioned issues.},

Recruitment of beta cells is also seen in isolated islets exposed to glucose. The sigmoidal dose-response curve for glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis thus reflects a heterogeneous responsiveness of pancreatic beta cells rather than a progressively increasing activity of functionally homogeneous cells.

The functional significance of this metabolic heterogeneity was assessed by comparing protein synthesis in metabolically responsive and unresponsive subpopulations, shortly after their separation by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting. The glucose-sensitive subpopulation exhibited four- to fivefold higher rates of insulin synthesis during 60-min incubations at 2.5-10 mM glucose. Its higher biosynthetic activity was mainly caused by recruitment of cells into active synthesis and, to a lesser extent, by higher biosynthetic activity per recruited cell. Cells from the glucose-sensitive subpopulation were larger, and presented a threefold higher density of a pale secretory vesicle subtype, which is thought to contain unprocessed proinsulin. It is concluded that intercellular differences in metabolic responsiveness result in functional heterogeneity of the pancreatic B cell population.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Over 90\% of patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic β-cells are endocrine cells that produce and secrete insulin, an essential endocrine hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. Deficits in β-cell function and mass play key roles in the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes. Apoptosis has been considered as the main contributor of β-cell dysfunction and decrease in β-cell mass for a long time. However, recent studies suggest that β-cell failure occurs mainly due to increased β-cell dedifferentiation rather than limited β-cell proliferation or increased β-cell death. In this review, we summarize the current advances in the understanding of the pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation process including potential mechanisms. A better understanding of β-cell dedifferentiation process will help to identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent and/or reverse β-cell loss in type 2 diabetes.},

While the major environmental factors, diet and activity level, are well known, identification of the genetic factors has been a challenge. However, recent years have seen an explosion of genetic variants in risk and protection of T2D due to the technical development that has allowed genome-wide association studies and next-generation sequencing. Today, more than 120 variants have been convincingly replicated for association with T2D and many more with diabetes-related traits. Still, these variants only explain a small proportion of the total heritability of T2D. In this review, we address the possibilities to elucidate the genetic landscape of T2D as well as discuss pitfalls with current strategies to identify the elusive unknown heritability including the possibility that our definition of diabetes and its subgroups is imprecise and thereby makes the identification of genetic causes difficult.},

However, access to human pancreatic islets is limited. Pancreatic tissue for islet retrieval can be obtained from brain-dead organ donors or from individuals undergoing pancreatectomy, often referred to as ‘living donors’. Different protocols for human islet procurement can substantially impact islet function. This variability, coupled with heterogeneity between individuals and islets, results in analytical challenges to separate genuine disease pathology or differences between human donors from experimental noise. There are currently no international guidelines for human donor phenotyping, islet procurement and functional characterization. This lack of standardization means that substantial investments from multiple international efforts towards improved understanding of diabetes pathology cannot be fully leveraged. In this Perspective, we overview the status of the field of human islet research, highlight the challenges and propose actions that could accelerate research progress and increase understanding of type 2 diabetes to slow its pandemic spreading.},

Here, we conduct a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of pancreatic islets obtained from metabolically profiled pancreatectomized living human donors stratified along the glycemic continuum, from normoglycemia to T2D. We find that islet pools isolated from surgical samples by laser-capture microdissection display remarkably more heterogeneous transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in patients with diabetes than in non-diabetic controls. The differential regulation of islet gene expression is already observed in prediabetic individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. Our findings demonstrate a progressive, but disharmonic, remodelling of mature beta cells, challenging current hypotheses of linear trajectories toward precursor or transdifferentiation stages in T2D. Furthermore, through integration of islet transcriptomics with preoperative blood plasma lipidomics, we define the relative importance of gene coexpression modules and lipids that are positively or negatively associated with HbA1c levels, pointing to potential prognostic markers.},

Here, we exploit freshly explanted pancreas specimens from metabolically phenotyped surgical patients using an in situ tissue slice technology. This approach allows assessment of β cell volume and function within pancreas samples of metabolically stratified individuals. We show that, in tissue of pre-diabetic, impaired glucose-tolerant subjects, β cell volume is unchanged, but function significantly deteriorates, exhibiting increased basal release and loss of first-phase insulin secretion. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, function within the sustained β cell volume further declines. These results indicate that dysfunction of persisting β cells is a key factor in the early development and progression of type 2 diabetes, representing a major target for diabetes prevention and therapy.},

	doi = {10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304636},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The biological mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance have not been fully elucidated. We have shown that insulin resistance or glucose intolerance in diet-induced obese mice is related to a shift in the ratio of pro- and anti-inflammatory T cells in adipose tissue. We sought to test the hypothesis that the balance of T-cell phenotypes would be similarly related to insulin resistance in human obesity.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Healthy overweight or obese human subjects underwent adipose-tissue biopsies and quantification of insulin-mediated glucose disposal by the modified insulin suppression test. T-cell subsets were quantified by flow cytometry in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Results showed that CD4 and CD8 T cells infiltrate both depots, with proinflammatory T-helper (Th)-1, Th17, and CD8 T cells, significantly more frequent in VAT as compared with SAT. T-cell profiles in SAT and VAT correlated significantly with one another and with peripheral blood. Th1 frequency in SAT and VAT correlated directly, whereas Th2 frequency in VAT correlated inversely, with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations. Th2 in both depots and peripheral blood was inversely associated with systemic insulin resistance. Furthermore, Th1 in SAT correlated with plasma interleukin-6. Relative expression of associated cytokines, measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction, reflected flow cytometry results. Most notably, adipose tissue expression of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 was inversely associated with insulin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: CD4 and CD8 T cells populate human adipose tissue and the relative frequency of Th1 and Th2 are highly associated with systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. These findings point to the adaptive immune system as a potential mediator between obesity and insulin resistance or inflammation. Identification of antigenic stimuli in adipose tissue may yield novel targets for treatment of obesity-associated metabolic disease.},

T2D generally results from progressive impairment of the pancreatic islets to adapt β-cell mass and function in the setting of insulin resistance and increased insulin demand. Several studies have shown an age-related decline in peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, a precise understanding of the pancreatic β-cell response in ageing is still lacking. In this review, we summarize the age-related alterations, adaptations and/or failures of β-cells at the molecular, morphological and functional levels in mouse and human. Age-associated alterations include processes such as β-cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell identity that can influence β-cell mass. Age-related changes also affect β-cell function at distinct steps including electrical activity, Ca2+ signaling and insulin secretion, among others. We will consider the potential impact of these alterations and those mediated by senescence pathways on β-cells and their implications in age-related T2D. Finally, given the great diversity of results in the field of β-cell ageing, we will discuss the sources of this heterogeneity. A better understanding of β-cell biology during ageing, particularly at older ages, will improve our insight into the contribution of β-cells to age-associated T2D and may boost new therapeutic strategies.},

Studies have demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress augments the suppressive phenotypes of immune cells; however, the molecular mechanisms underpinning this process and how it links to the metabolic reprogramming of immunosuppressive macrophages remain elusive. In the present study, we report that the helper T cell 2 cytokine interleukin-4 and the tumor microenvironment increase the activity of a protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)-signaling cascade in macrophages and promote immunosuppressive M2 activation and proliferation. Loss of PERK signaling impeded mitochondrial respiration and lipid oxidation critical for M2 macrophages. PERK activation mediated the upregulation of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) and serine biosynthesis via the downstream transcription factor ATF-4. Increased serine biosynthesis resulted in enhanced mitochondrial function and α-ketoglutarate production required for JMJD3-dependent epigenetic modification. Inhibition of PERK suppressed macrophage immunosuppressive activity and could enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 inhibition in melanoma.

	abstract = {Aim To determine the impact of a functional human islet clock on insulin secretion and gene transcription. Methods Efficient circadian clock disruption was achieved in human pancreatic islet cells by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CLOCK. Human islet secretory function was assessed in the presence or absence of a functional circadian clock by stimulated insulin secretion assays, and by continuous around-the-clock monitoring of basal insulin secretion. Large-scale transcription analysis was accomplished by RNA sequencing, followed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of selected targets. Results Circadian clock disruption resulted in a significant decrease in both acute and chronic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, basal insulin secretion by human islet cells synchronized in vitro exhibited a circadian pattern, which was perturbed upon clock disruption. RNA sequencing analysis suggested alterations in 352 transcript levels upon circadian clock disruption. Among them, key regulators of the insulin secretion pathway (GNAQ, ATP1A1, ATP5G2, KCNJ11) and transcripts required for granule maturation and release (VAMP3, STX6, SLC30A8) were affected. Conclusions Using our newly developed experimental approach for efficient clock disruption in human pancreatic islet cells, we show for the first time that a functional ?-cell clock is required for proper basal and stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, clock disruption has a profound impact on the human islet transcriptome, in particular, on the genes involved in insulin secretion.},

Carriers of CPE mutations have elevated plasma proinsulin and develop severe obesity and hyperglycemia. We aimed to determine whether loss of Cpe in pancreatic β-cells disrupts proinsulin processing and accelerates development of diabetes and obesity in mice. Pancreatic β-cell–specific Cpe knockout mice (βCpeKO; Cpefl/fl x Ins1Cre/+) lack mature insulin granules and have elevated proinsulin in plasma; however, glucose-and KCl-stimulated insulin secretion in βCpeKO islets remained intact. High-fat diet–fed βCpeKO mice showed weight gain and glucose tolerance comparable with those of Wt littermates. Notably, β-cell area was increased in chow-fed βCpeKO mice and β-cell replication was elevated in βCpeKO islets. Transcriptomic analysis of βCpeKO β-cells revealed elevated glycolysis and Hif1α-target gene expression. On high glucose challenge, β-cells from βCpeKO mice showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, reduced MafA, and elevated Aldh1a3 transcript levels. Following multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections, βCpeKO mice had accelerated development of hyperglycemia with reduced β-cell insulin and Glut2 expression. These findings suggest that Cpe and proper proinsulin processing are critical in maintaining β-cell function during the development of hyperglycemia.Carboxypeptidase E (Cpe) is an enzyme that removes the carboxy-terminal arginine and lysine residues from peptide precursors.Mutations in CPE lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans, and whole-body Cpe knockout or mutant mice are obese and hyperglycemic and fail to convert proinsulin to insulin.We show that β-cell–specific Cpe deletion in mice (βCpeKO) does not lead to the development of obesity or hyperglycemia, even after prolonged high-fat diet treatment. However, β-cell proliferation rate and β-cell area are increased, and the development of hyperglycemia induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections is accelerated in βCpeKO mice.},

	abstract = {Objective Low-grade chronic inflammation emerges as a potent driver of insulin resistance and glucose dysregulation in obesity and associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The liver, subcutaneous fat and the immune system participate in disturbances of metabolism. Type I interferon (IFN) signalling initiated by innate and adaptive immunity modulates inflammatory responses consequent to infection. However, little is known about the role of type I IFN signalling in metabolic diseases and the development of NAFLD.
Design We determined the impact of type I IFN signalling by tissue-specific deletion of interferon (α and β) receptor 1 (Ifnar1) in hepatocytes (Ifnar1Δhep), adipocytes (Ifnar1Δat), intestinal epithelial cells (Ifnar1ΔIEC) or myelocytes (Ifnar1Δmyel) on glucose metabolism, obesity and hepatic disease in mice exposed to a high-fat or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of type I IFN-regulated genes in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB).
Results Long chain fatty acids induce type I IFN responses in murine hepatocytes and macrophages and exposure to a high-fat diet elicited type I IFN-regulated gene expression in the liver of wild-type mice. Hepatocyte-specific, but not adipose tissue-specific deletion of Ifnar1 worsened steatosis and inflammation induced by the MCD diet. In contrast, adipose-specific, but not hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ifnar1 deteriorated metabolic dysregulation induced by a high-fat diet, indicated by increased weight gain, insulin resistance and an impaired glucose tolerance. Abrogated type I IFN signalling in myeloid or intestinal epithelial cells did not modulate susceptibility to metabolic or hepatic disease. Improved metabolic control in patients with obesity after LAGB was associated with increased expression of type I IFN-regulated genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver.
Conclusions Our study implicates a role for adipose and hepatocyte type I IFN signalling in diet-induced metabolic dysregulation and hepatic disease. Further studies on type I IFN signalling in metabolic diseases are warranted.},

	abstract = {A carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme was detected in the soluble fraction of purified insulin secretory granules, and implicated in insulin biosynthesis. To investigate the role of this activity further, we purified the enzyme from rat insulinoma tissue by gel-filtration chromatography and affinity elution from p-aminobenzoyl-arginine. A yield of 42\%, with a purification factor of 674 over the homogenate, was achieved. Analysis of the purified carboxypeptidase by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under either reducing or non-reducing conditions showed it to be a monomeric protein of apparent Mr 55,000. The preparation was also homogeneous by high-performance gel-filtration chromatography. The enzyme bound to concanavalin A, showing it to be a glycoprotein. Amino acid analysis or chemical deglycosylation and SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated a protein Mr of 50,000, suggesting a carbohydrate content of approx. 9\% by weight. The purified enzyme was able to remove basic amino acids from the C-terminus of proinsulin tryptic peptides to generate insulin, but did not further degrade the mature hormone. It was inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, and stimulated 5-fold by CoCl2. The pH optimum of the conversion of diarginyl-insulin into insulin was in the range 5-6, with little activity above pH 6.5. Activity was also expressed towards a dansylated tripeptide substrate (dansyl-phenylalanyl-leucyl-arginine; Km = 17.5 microM), and had a pH optimum of 5.5. These properties are indistinguishable from those of the activity located in secretory granules, and are compatible with the intragranular environment. The insulin-secretory-granule carboxypeptidase shared several properties of carboxypeptidase H from bovine adrenal medulla and pituitary. We propose that the carboxypeptidase that we purified is the pancreatic isoenzyme of carboxypeptidase H (crino carboxypeptidase B; EC 3.4.17.10), and is involved in the biosynthesis of insulin in the pancreatic beta-cell.},

We now demonstrate that TTR tetramer has a positive role in pancreatic β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. TTR promoted glucose-induced increases in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and insulin release. This resulted from a direct effect on glucose-induced electrical activity and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. TTR also protected against β-cell apoptosis. The concentration of TTR tetramer was decreased, whereas that of a monomeric form was increased in sera from patients with type 1 diabetes. The monomer was without effect on glucose-induced insulin release and apoptosis. Thus, TTR tetramer constitutes a component in normal β-cell function. Conversion of TTR tetramer to monomer may be involved in the development of β-cell failure/destruction in type 1 diabetes.},

The pathophysiology of metabolic diseases is complex but has been shown to be closely associated with sterile inflammation, which is initiated by various danger molecules derived from metabolic overload, such as oxidized low-density lipoproteins (OxLDLs), free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and cholesterol. These danger signals are sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate proinflammatory signaling pathways and promote the release of proinflammatory mediators, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation. Although these harmful metabolic stimuli are generally regarded as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a more specific definition and accurate classification for these DAMPs is still missing. In this opinion, we classify the harmful metabolic stimuli that can incite inflammatory responses and tissue damage via instigating PRRs as metabolism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), and we summarize their roles in metaflammation-mediated metabolic diseases.},

IL-33 promoted β cell function through islet-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that elicited retinoic acid (RA)-producing capacities in macrophages and dendritic cells via the secretion of IL-13 and colony-stimulating factor 2. In turn, local RA signaled to the β cells to increase insulin secretion. This IL-33-ILC2 axis was activated after acute β cell stress but was defective during chronic obesity. Accordingly, IL-33 injections rescued islet function in obese mice. Our findings provide evidence that an immunometabolic crosstalk between islet-derived IL-33, ILC2s, and myeloid cells fosters insulin secretion.},

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ is an integral part of the metabolic inflammation circuit and contributes significantly to metabolic dysfunction. The underlying mechanism, however, remains largely unknown. In the present study, we report that IFN-γ disrupts the expression of genes key to cellular metabolism and energy expenditure by repressing the expression and activity of SIRT1 at the transcription level. Further analysis reveals that IFN-γ requires class II transactivator (CIITA) to repress SIRT1 transcription. CIITA, once induced by IFN-γ, is recruited to the SIRT1 promoter by hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) and promotes down-regulation of SIRT1 transcription via active deacetylation of core histones surrounding the SIRT1 proximal promoter. Silencing CIITA or HIC1 restores SIRT1 activity and expression of metabolic genes in skeletal muscle cells challenged with IFN-γ. Therefore, our data delineate an IFN-γ/HIC1/CIITA axis that contributes to metabolic dysfunction by suppressing SIRT1 transcription in skeletal muscle cells and as such shed new light on the development of novel therapeutic strategies against type 2 diabetes.},

We examined mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) inflammation, and endothelial function of small mesenteric artery (SMA) in control mice (m Leprdb), diabetic mice (Leprdb), m Leprdb treated with IFNγ, and Leprdb treated with anti-IFNγ or anti-monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (anti-MCP-1). mRNA and protein expression of IFNγ and MCP-1 were increased in MAT of Leprdb, accompanied by increased T-lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. Anti-IFNγ reduced MAT inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokine expression in Leprdb, while IFNγ treatment showed the opposite effects in m Leprdb. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasorelaxation of SMA was impaired in Leprdb versus m Leprdb, but sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced vasorelaxation was comparable. Both anti-IFNγ and anti-MCP-1 improved endothelial function of Leprdb, while IFNγ treatment impaired endothelial function of m Leprdb. Superoxide production was higher in both MAT and SMA of Leprdb mice, and anti-IFNγ reduced MAT and SMA superoxide production. Macrophage accumulation in the adventitia of SMA, and mRNA expression of MCP-1 in SMA were increased in Leprdb and IFNγ-treated m Leprdb, but reduced in anti-IFNγ treated Leprdb.

Differentiated human adipocytes were treated with IFNγ ± pharmacological inhibitors prior to insulin stimulation. [3H]Glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation were assessed as markers of insulin sensitivity. IFNγ induced sustained loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in human adipocytes, coincident with reduced Akt phosphorylation and down-regulation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, and GLUT4. Loss of adipocyte triglyceride storage was observed with IFNγ co-incident with reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, adiponectin, perilipin, fatty acid synthase, and lipoprotein lipase. Treatment with IFNγ also blocked differentiation of pre-adipocytes to the mature phenotype. IFNγ-induced robust STAT1 phosphorylation and SOCS1 mRNA expression, with modest, transient STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3 induction. Preincubation with a non-selective JAK inhibitor restored glucose uptake and Akt phosphorylation while completely reversing IFNγ suppression of adipogenic mRNAs and adipocyte differentiation. Specific inhibition of JAK2 or JAK3 failed to block IFNγ effects suggesting a predominant role for JAK1-STAT1. We demonstrate that IFNγ attenuates insulin sensitivity and suppresses differentiation in human adipocytes, an effect most likely mediated via sustained JAK-STAT1 pathway activation.},

Knowledge of islet-resident antigen presenting cells in rodents is substantial, but quite scarce in humans, in particular regarding dendritic cells. Differences in blood between healthy and diseased individuals were reported, but it remains elusive to what extend these contribute to T1D onset. Increasing our understanding of the interaction between ß-cells and innate immune cells may provide new insights into disease initiation and development that could ultimately point to future treatment options.

We show here that hypoxia regulates Net differently from the other TCFs and that Net plays a role in the hypoxic response in vivo in mice and in cells. Hypoxia induces Net depletion from target promoters, nuclear export, ubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation. Key mediators of the hypoxic response, the prolyl-4-hydroxylases containing domain proteins (PHDs), regulate Net. PHD downregulation in normoxia leads to Net degradation, and PHD overexpression delays Net downregulation by hypoxia. Net inhibition by RNA interference or mutation leads to altered regulation by hypoxia of the Net targets PAI-1, c-fos, and egr-1. We propose that hypoxia stimulates transcription of target promoters through removal of the repressor function of Net. Interestingly, the hematocrit response to a chemical inducer of hypoxia-like responses (cobalt chloride) is strongly altered in Net mutant mice. Our results show that the Net TCF is part of the biological response to hypoxia, adding a new component to an important pathological and physiological process.},

	abstract = {Background
Myriad challenges to the proper folding and structural maturation of secretory pathway client proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) — a condition referred to as “ER stress” — activate intracellular signaling pathways termed the unfolded protein response (UPR).
Scope of review
Through executing transcriptional and translational programs the UPR restores homeostasis in those cells experiencing manageable levels of ER stress. But the UPR also actively triggers cell degeneration and apoptosis in those cells that are encountering ER stress levels that exceed irremediable thresholds. Thus, UPR outputs are “double-edged”. In pancreatic islet β-cells, numerous genetic mutations affecting the balance between these opposing UPR functions cause diabetes mellitus in both rodents and humans, amply demonstrating the principle that the UPR is critical for the proper functioning and survival of the cell.
Major conclusions
Specifically, we have found that the UPR master regulator IRE1α kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) triggers apoptosis, β-cell degeneration, and diabetes, when ER stress reaches critical levels. Based on these mechanistic findings, we find that novel small molecule compounds that inhibit IRE1α during such “terminal” UPR signaling can spare ER stressed β-cells from death, perhaps affording future opportunities to test new drug candidates for disease modification in patients suffering from diabetes.},

There are approximately 2000 beta-cells per islet, and approximately one million islets of Langerhans scattered throughout the pancreas. The islet in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has deficient beta-cell mass due to increased beta-cell apoptosis and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Accumulating evidence implicates toxic IAPP oligomers in the mediation of beta-cell apoptosis in T2D. Humans, monkeys, and cats express an amyloidogenic toxic form of IAPP and spontaneously develop diabetes characterized by islet amyloid deposits. However, longitudinal studies of islet pathology in humans are impossible, and studies in nonhuman primates and cats are costly and impractical. Rodent IAPP is not amyloidogenic, thus commonly used rodent models of diabetes do not recapitulate islet pathology in humans. To investigate the diabetogenic role of human IAPP (h-IAPP), several mouse models and, more recently, a rat model transgenic for h-IAPP have been developed. Studies in these models have revealed that the toxic effect of h-IAPP on beta-cell apoptosis demonstrates a threshold-dependent effect. Specifically, increasing h-IAPP transgene expression by breeding or induction of insulin resistance leads to increased beta-cell apoptosis and diabetes. These transgenic rodent models for h-IAPP provide an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for h-IAPP-induced beta-cell apoptosis further and to test novel approaches to the prevention and treatment of T2D.},

Pathological changes such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular complications inevitably occur in the body with the progression of the disease. DM is mainly categorized into 2 sub-types, type I DM and type II DM. While type I DM is generally treated through insulin replacement therapy, type II DM is treated with oral hypoglycaemics. The major drug therapy for type II DM comprises of insulin secretagogues, biguanides, insulin sensitizers, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, incretin mimetics, amylin antagonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Dual drug therapies are often recommended in patients who are unable to achieve therapeutic goals with first line oral hypoglycaemic agents as monotherapy. Inspite of the appreciable therapeutic benefits, the conventional dosage forms depicts differential bioavailability and short half-life, mandating frequent dosage and causing greater side effects leading to therapy ineffectiveness and patient non-compliance. Given the pathological complexity of the said disease, nanotechnology-based approaches are more enticing as it comes with added advantage of site-specific drug delivery with higher bioavailability and reduced dosage regimen.

	abstract = {It is well known that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a globally increasing health burden. Despite recent therapeutic advances and the availability of many different classes of antihyperglycemic therapy, a large proportion of people do not achieve glycemic control. A decline in pancreatic beta-cell function has been defined as a key contributing factor to progression of T2D. In fact, a significant proportion of beta-cell secretory capacity is thought to be lost well before the diagnosis of T2D is made. Several models have been proposed to explain the reduction in beta-cell function, including reduced beta-cell number, beta-cell exhaustion, and dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation into other cell types. However, there have been reports that suggest remission of T2D is possible, and it is believed that beta-cell dysfunction may be, in part, reversible. As such, the question of whether beta cells are committed to failure in people with T2D is complex. It is now widely accepted that early restoration of normoglycemia may protect beta-cell function. Key to the successful implementation of this approach in clinical practice is the appropriate assessment of individuals at risk of beta-cell failure, and the early implementation of appropriate treatment options. In this review, we discuss the progression of T2D in the context of beta-cell failure and describe how C-peptide testing can be used to assess beta-cell function in primary care practice. In conclusion, significant beta-cell dysfunction is likely in individuals with certain clinical characteristics of T2D, such as long duration of disease, high glycated hemoglobin (≥9\%), and/or long-term use of therapies that continuously stimulate the beta cell. In these people, measurement of beta-cell status could assist with choice of appropriate therapy to delay or potentially reverse beta-cell dysfunction and the progression of T2D.},

Using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, we were able to derive β-like cells similar to the endogenous insulin-secreting cells in mice. These β-like cells secreted insulin in response to glucose and corrected a hyperglycemic phenotype in two mouse models of type 1 and 2 diabetes via an iPS cell transplant. Long-term correction of hyperglycemia was achieved, as determined by blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels.

Given the role of this not related to infection inflammation in the development of both: insulin resistance and insulitis, anti-inflammatory strategies could be helpful not only to control T2D symptoms but also to treat its causes. This review presents current concepts regarding the role of metaflammation in the development of T2D in obese individuals as well as data concerning possible application of different anti-inflammatory strategies (including lifestyle interventions, the extra-glycemic potential of classical antidiabetic compounds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory therapies, and bariatric surgery) in the management of T2D.},

	abstract = {The worldwide prevalence of obesity is increasing, raising health concerns regarding obesity-related complications. Chronic inflammation has been characterized as a major contributor to the development of obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders. The purpose of the current study is to assess whether the overexpression of interferon beta (IFNβ1), an immune-modulating cytokine, will attenuate high-fat diet-induced adipose inflammation and protect animals against obesity development. Using hydrodynamic gene transfer to elevate and sustain blood concentration of IFNβ1 in mice fed a high-fat diet, we showed that the overexpression of Ifnβ1 gene markedly suppressed immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue, and attenuated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Systemically, IFNβ1 blocked adipose tissue expansion and body weight gain, independent of food intake. Possible browning of white adipose tissue might also contribute to blockade of weight gain. More importantly, IFNβ1 improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. These results suggest that targeting inflammation represents a practical strategy to block the development of obesity and its related pathologies. In addition, IFNβ1-based therapies have promising potential for clinical applications for the prevention and treatment of various inflammation-driven pathologies.},

These findings raise the question of how fat inflammation can escape the powerful armamentarium of cells and molecules normally responsible for guarding against a runaway immune response. CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T regulatory (T(reg)) cells with a unique phenotype were highly enriched in the abdominal fat of normal mice, but their numbers were strikingly and specifically reduced at this site in insulin-resistant models of obesity. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments revealed that these T(reg) cells influenced the inflammatory state of adipose tissue and, thus, insulin resistance. Cytokines differentially synthesized by fat-resident regulatory and conventional T cells directly affected the synthesis of inflammatory mediators and glucose uptake by cultured adipocytes. These observations suggest that harnessing the anti-inflammatory properties of T(reg) cells to inhibit elements of the metabolic syndrome may have therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {Obesity and its associated metabolic syndromes represent a growing global challenge, yet mechanistic understanding of this pathology and current therapeutics are unsatisfactory. We discovered that CD4(+) T lymphocytes, resident in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), control insulin resistance in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Analyses of human tissue suggest that a similar process may also occur in humans. DIO VAT-associated T cells show severely biased T cell receptor V(alpha) repertoires, suggesting antigen-specific expansion. CD4(+) T lymphocyte control of glucose homeostasis is compromised in DIO progression, when VAT accumulates pathogenic interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells, overwhelming static numbers of T(H)2 (CD4(+)GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3)(+)) and regulatory forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)(+) T cells. CD4(+) (but not CD8(+)) T cell transfer into lymphocyte-free Rag1-null DIO mice reversed weight gain and insulin resistance, predominantly through T(H)2 cells. In obese WT and ob/ob (leptin-deficient) mice, brief treatment with CD3-specific antibody or its F(ab')(2) fragment, reduces the predominance of T(H)1 cells over Foxp3(+) cells, reversing insulin resistance for months, despite continuation of a high-fat diet. Our data suggest that the progression of obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities is under the pathophysiological control of CD4(+) T cells. The eventual failure of this control, with expanding adiposity and pathogenic VAT T cells, can successfully be reversed by immunotherapy.},

The expression of a range of hormone and neurotransmitter receptors allows δ-cells to integrate paracrine, endocrine, neural and nutritional inputs, and provide rapid and precise feedback modulations on glucagon and insulin secretion from α- and β-cells, respectively. Interestingly, the paracrine tone of δ-cells can be effectively modified in response to factors released by neighboring cells in this interactive communication, such as insulin, urocortin 3 and γ-aminobutyric acid from β-cells, glucagon, glutamate and glucagon-like peptide-1 from α-cells. In the setting of diabetes, defects in δ-cell function lead to suboptimal insulin and glucagon outputs and lift the glycemic set-point. The interaction of δ-cells and non-δ-cells also becomes defective in diabetes, with reduces paracrine feedback to β-cells to exacerbate hyperglycemia or enhanced inhibition of α-cells, disabling counter-regulation, to cause hypoglycemia. Thus, it is possible to restore/optimize islet function in diabetes targeting somatostatin signaling, which could open novel avenues for the development of effective diabetic treatments.},

Increased access to human tissue and the availability of more sophisticated molecular technologies have identified key insights into how α cell function and identity are preserved in healthy conditions and how they become dysfunctional in response to stress. These studies have revealed evidence of impaired glucagon secretion, shifts in α cell electrophysiology, changes in α cell mass, dysregulation of α cell transcription, and α-to-β cell conversion prior to and during diabetes. In this review, we outline the current state of research on α cell identity in health and disease. Evidence in model organisms and humans suggests that in addition to β cell dysfunction, diabetes is associated with a fundamental dysregulation of α cell identity. Importantly, epigenetic studies have revealed that α cells retain more poised and open chromatin at key cell-specific and diabetes-dysregulated genes, supporting the model that the inherent epigenetic plasticity of α cells makes them susceptible to the transcriptional changes that potentiate the loss of identity and function seen in diabetes. Thus, additional research into the maintenance of α cell identity and function is critical to fully understanding diabetes. Furthermore, these studies suggest α cells could represent an alternative source of new β cells for diabetes treatment.},

In α-cells, glucagon is found in electron-dense granules; granule exocytosis is calcium-dependent via P/Q-type Ca(2+)-channels, which may be clustered at designated cell membrane sites. Somatostatin-containing δ-cells are neuron-like, creating a network for intra-islet communication. Somatostatin 1-28 and 1-14 have a short bioactive half-life, suggesting inhibitory action via paracrine signaling. PP-cells are the most infrequent islet cell type. The embryologically separate ventral pancreas anlage contains PP-rich islets that are morphologically diffuse and α-cell deficient. Tissue samples taken from the head region are unlikely to be representative of the whole pancreas. PP has anorexic effects on gastro-intestinal function and alters insulin and glucagon secretion. Islet architecture is disrupted in rodent diabetic models, diabetic primates and human Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, with an increased α-cell population and relocation of non-β-cells to central areas of the islet. In diabetes, the transdifferentiation of non-β-cells, with changes in hormone content, suggests plasticity of islet cells but cellular function may be compromised. Understanding how diabetes-related disordered islet structure influences intra-islet cellular communication could clarify how non-β-cells contribute to the control of islet function.},

T2D is a complicated disea se that is triggered by the dysfunction of insulin-producing β cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Insulin injection partially compensates for the role of endogenous insulin which promotes glucose uptake, lipid synthesis and organ growth. However, lacking the continuous, rapid, and accurate glucose regulation by endogenous functional β cells, the current insulin injection therapy is unable to treat the root causes of the disease. Thus, new technologies such as human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived islets are needed for both identifying the key molecular and genetic causes of T2D and for achieving a long-term treatment. This perspective review will provide insight into the efficacy of hPSC-derived human islets for treating and understanding T2D. We discuss the evidence that β cells should be the primary target for T2D treatment, the use of stem cells for the modeling of T2D and the potential use of hPSC-derived islet transplantation for treating T2D.},

In an open-label, single-center, randomized crossover study, 26 adults with type 2 diabetes (7 women and 19 men; (mean ± s.d.) age, 59 ± 11 years; baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 75 ± 15 mmol mol−1 (9.0\% ± 1.4\%)) underwent two 8-week periods to compare the CamAPS HX fully closed-loop app with standard insulin therapy and a masked glucose sensor (control) in random order, with a 2-week to 4-week washout between periods. The primary endpoint was proportion of time in target glucose range (3.9–10.0 mmol l−1). Analysis was by intention to treat. Thirty participants were recruited between 16 December 2020 and 24 November 2021, of whom 28 were randomized to two groups (14 to closed-loop therapy first and 14 to control therapy first). Proportion of time in target glucose range (mean ± s.d.) was 66.3\% ± 14.9\% with closed-loop therapy versus 32.3\% ± 24.7\% with control therapy (mean difference, 35.3 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 28.0–42.6 percentage points; P {\textless} 0.001). Time {\textgreater} 10.0 mmol l−1 was 33.2\% ± 14.8\% with closed-loop therapy versus 67.0\% ± 25.2\% with control therapy (mean difference, −35.2 percentage points; 95\% CI, −42.8 to −27.5 percentage points; P {\textless} 0.001). Mean glucose was lower during the closed-loop therapy period than during the control therapy period (9.2 ± 1.2 mmol l−1 versus 12.6 ± 3.0 mmol l−1, respectively; mean difference, −3.6 mmol l−1; 95\% CI, −4.6 to −2.5 mmol l−1; P {\textless} 0.001). HbA1c was lower following closed-loop therapy (57 ± 9 mmol mol−1 (7.3\% ± 0.8\%)) than following control therapy (72 ± 13 mmol mol−1 (8.7\% ± 1.2\%); mean difference, −15 mmol mol−1; 95\% CI, −11 to −20 mmol l−1 (mean difference, −1.4\%; 95\% CI, −1.0 to −1.8\%); P {\textless} 0.001). Time {\textless} 3.9 mmol l−1 was similar between treatments (a median of 0.44\% (interquartile range, 0.19–0.81\%) during the closed-loop therapy period versus a median of 0.08\% (interquartile range, 0.00–1.05\%) during the control therapy period; P = 0.43). No severe hypoglycemia events occurred in either period. One treatment-related serious adverse event occurred during the closed-loop therapy period. Fully closed-loop insulin delivery improved glucose control without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard insulin therapy and may represent a safe and efficacious method to improve outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes.

	abstract = {Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) induces a profound host shutoff during lytic infection. The virion host shutoff (vhs) protein plays a key role in this process by efficiently cleaving host and viral mRNAs. Furthermore, the onset of viral DNA replication is accompanied by a rapid decline in host transcriptional activity. To dissect relative contributions of both mechanisms and elucidate gene-specific host transcriptional responses throughout the first 8 h of lytic HSV-1 infection, we used transcriptome sequencing of total, newly transcribed (4sU-labeled) and chromatin-associated RNA in wild-type (WT) and Δvhs mutant infection of primary human fibroblasts. Following virus entry, vhs activity rapidly plateaued at an elimination rate of around 30\% of cellular mRNAs per hour until 8 h postinfection (p.i.). In parallel, host transcriptional activity dropped to 10 to 20\%. While the combined effects of both phenomena dominated infection-induced changes in total RNA, extensive gene-specific transcriptional regulation was observable in chromatin-associated RNA and was surprisingly concordant between WT and Δvhs infections. Both induced strong transcriptional upregulation of a small subset of genes that were poorly expressed prior to infection but already primed by H3K4me3 histone marks at their promoters. Most interestingly, analysis of chromatin-associated RNA revealed vhs-nuclease-activity-dependent transcriptional downregulation of at least 150 cellular genes, in particular of many integrin adhesome and extracellular matrix components. This was accompanied by a vhs-dependent reduction in protein levels by 8 h p.i. for many of these genes. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms that govern cellular RNA metabolism during the first 8 h of lytic HSV-1 infection.
IMPORTANCE The HSV-1 virion host shutoff (vhs) protein efficiently cleaves both host and viral mRNAs in a translation-dependent manner. In this study, we model and quantify changes in vhs activity, as well as virus-induced global loss of host transcriptional activity, during productive HSV-1 infection. In general, HSV-1-induced alterations in total RNA levels were dominated by these two global effects. In contrast, chromatin-associated RNA depicted gene-specific transcriptional changes. This revealed highly concordant transcriptional changes in WT and Δvhs infections, confirmed DUX4 as a key transcriptional regulator in HSV-1 infection, and identified vhs-dependent transcriptional downregulation of the integrin adhesome and extracellular matrix components. The latter explained seemingly gene-specific effects previously attributed to vhs-mediated mRNA degradation and resulted in a concordant loss in protein levels by 8 h p.i. for many of the respective genes.},

We now report the pseudotime ordering of single β-cells from humans without diabetes detected by large-scale RNA sequencing. We identified major states with 1) low UPR and low insulin gene expression, 2) low UPR and high insulin gene expression, or 3) high UPR and low insulin gene expression. The latter state was enriched for proliferating cells. Stressed human β-cells do not dedifferentiate and show little propensity for apoptosis.

	abstract = {Poor dietary habits contribute to increased incidences of obesity and related co-morbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). The biological, genetic, and pathological implications of T2D, are commonly investigated using animal models induced by a dietary intervention. In spite of significant research contributions, animal models have limitations regarding the translation to human pathology, which leads to questioning their clinical relevance. Important considerations include diet-specific effects on whole organism energy balance and glucose and insulin homeostasis, as well as tissue-specific changes in insulin and glucose tolerance. This review will examine the T2D-like phenotype in rodents resulting from common diet-induced models and their relevance to the human disease state. Emphasis will be placed on the disparity in percentages and type of dietary fat, the duration of intervention, and whole organism and tissue-specific changes in rodents. An evaluation of these models will help to identify a diet-induced rodent model with the greatest clinical relevance to the human T2D pathology. We propose that a 45\% high-fat diet composed of approximately one-third saturated fats and two-thirds unsaturated fats may provide a diet composition that aligns closely to average Western diet macronutrient composition, and induces metabolic alterations mirrored by clinical populations.},

A lean ZDF rat with the propensity for beta-cell failure was crossed with a polygenetically obese Crl:CD (SD) rat. Offspring were selectively inbred for obesity and diabetes for {\textgreater}30 generations. In the current study, ZDSD rats were followed for 6 months; routine clinical metabolic endpoints were included throughout the study. In the prediabetic metabolic syndrome phase, ZDSD rats exhibited obesity with increased body fat, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and elevated HbA1c. As disease progressed to overt diabetes, ZDSD rats demonstrated elevated glucose levels, abnormal oral glucose tolerance, increases in HbA1c levels, reductions in body weight, increased insulin resistance with decreasing insulin levels, and dyslipidemia. The ZDSD rat develops prediabetic metabolic syndrome and T2D in a manner that mirrors the development of metabolic syndrome and T2D in humans. ZDSD rats will provide a novel, translational animal model for the study of human metabolic diseases and for the development of new therapies.},

One of the major concerns associated with diabetes relates to the development of micro- and macrovascular complications, which contribute greatly to the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Progression of the disease from prediabetic state to overt diabetes and the development of complications occur over many years. Assessment of interventions designed to delay or prevent disease progression or complications in humans also takes years and requires tremendous resources. To better study both the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic agents, appropriate animal models of type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus are needed. However, for an animal model to have relevance to the study of diabetes, either the characteristics of the animal model should mirror the pathophysiology and natural history of diabetes or the model should develop complications of diabetes with an etiology similar to that of the human condition. There appears to be no single animal model that encompasses all of these characteristics, but there are many that provide very similar characteristics in one or more aspects of T2D in humans. Use of the appropriate animal model based on these similarities can provide much needed data on pathophysiological mechanisms operative in human T2D.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic elevation in blood glucose levels, resulting from inadequate insulin production, defective cellular response to extracellular insulin, and/or impaired glucose metabolism. The two main types that account for most diabetics are type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), each with their own pathophysiological features. T1D is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This leads to lack of insulin, a vital hormone for regulating blood sugar levels and cellular glucose uptake. As a result, those with T1D depend on lifelong insulin therapy to control their blood glucose level. In contrast, T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body’s cells do not respond effectively to insulin, coupled with a relative insulin deficiency. This form of diabetes is often associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and/or genetic factors, and it is managed with lifestyle changes and oral medications. Animal models play a crucial role in diabetes research. However, given the distinct differences between T1DM and T2DM, it is imperative for researchers to employ specific animal models tailored to each condition for a better understanding of the impaired mechanisms underlying each condition, and for assessing the efficacy of new therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the distinct animal models used in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus research and discuss their strengths and limitations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Stem cell-based islet organoids faithfully recapitulate islet development in vitro and provide large amounts of three-dimensional functional islet biomimetic materials with a morphological structure and cellular composition similar to those of native islets. Thus, islet organoids hold great promise for modeling islet development and function, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the onset of diabetes, providing an in vitro human organ model for infection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and contributing to drug screening and autologous islet transplantation. However, the currently established islet organoids are generally immature compared with native islets, and further efforts should be made to improve the heterogeneity and functionality of islet organoids, making it an authentic and informative disease model for diabetes. Here, we review the advances and challenges in the generation of islet organoids, focusing on human pluripotent stem cell-derived islet organoids, and the potential applications of islet organoids as disease models and regenerative therapies for diabetes.},

Here, we show that, although acute inflammatory stresses from different etiologies result in highly similar genomic responses in humans, the responses in corresponding mouse models correlate poorly with the human conditions and also, one another. Among genes changed significantly in humans, the murine orthologs are close to random in matching their human counterparts (e.g., R2 between 0.0 and 0.1). In addition to improvements in the current animal model systems, our study supports higher priority for translational medical research to focus on the more complex human conditions rather than relying on mouse models to study human inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {Leading animal models are powerful tools for translational research, but they also present obstacles. Poorly conducted preclinical research in animals is a common cause of translational failure, but even when such research is well-designed and carefully executed, challenges remain. In particular, dominant models may bias research directions, elide essential aspects of human disease, omit important context, or subtly shift research targets. Recognizing these stumbling blocks can help us find ways to avoid them: employing a wider range of models, incorporating more realistic environmental conditions, better aligning studies between animals and patients, and focusing on human biology and therapeutic goals. Such changes are costly; but insisting it would be impractical or unrealistic to change strategies offers no way out of the current impasse. Rather, we must acknowledge the obstacles as well as the advantages presented by core models, and direct some of our investments in translational research toward getting around them.},

Conversely, BHLHE40 deficiency in hypoxic MIN6 cells or β‐cells of ob/ob mice reverses defects in insulin secretion. Mechanistically, BHLHE40 represses the expression of Mafa, encoding the transcription factor musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family A (MAFA), by attenuating the binding of pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) to its enhancer region. Impaired insulin secretion in hypoxic β‐cells was recovered by MAFA re‐expression.

We have identified, in a large-scale analysis of RNA expression using microarrays, more than 370 genes that are regulated by Net in hypoxia. In order to gain insights into the role of Net in hypoxia, we have analysed in parallel the genes regulated by HIF-1α, the classical factor involved in the response to hypoxia. We identified about 190 genes that are regulated by HIF-1α in hypoxia. Surprisingly, when we compare the genes induced by hypoxia that require either Net or HIF-1α, the majority are the same (75\%), suggesting that the functions of both factors are closely linked. Interestingly, in hypoxia, Net regulates the expression of several genes known to control HIF-1α stability, including PHD2, PHD3 and Siah2, suggesting that Net regulates the stability of HIF-1α. We found that inhibition of Net by RNAi leads to decreased HIF-1α expression at the protein level in hypoxia. These results indicate that Net participates in the transcriptional response to hypoxia by regulation of HIF-1α protein stability.},

	abstract = {A hallmark of diabetes mellitus is the inability of pancreatic β-cells to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin for maintaining normoglycemia. The formation of smaller islets may underlie the development of a diabetic phenotype, as a decreased β-cell mass will produce an insufficient amount of insulin. For a pharmacological intervention it is crucial to identify the proteins determining β-cell mass. Here, we identified the ternary complex factor (TCF) Elk-1 as a regulator of the size of pancreatic islets. Elk-1 mediates, together with a dimer of the serum-response factor (SRF), serum response element-regulated gene transcription. Elk-1 is activated in glucose-treated pancreatic β-cells but the biological functions of this protein in β-cells are so far unknown. Elk-1 and homologous TCF proteins are expressed in islets and insulinoma cells. Gene targeting experiments revealed that the TCF proteins show redundant activities. To solve the problem of functional redundancy of these homologous proteins, we generated conditional transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Elk-1 in pancreatic β-cells. The mutant competes with the wild-type TCFs for DNA and SRF-binding. Expression of the Elk-1 mutant in pancreatic β-cells resulted in the generation of significantly smaller islets and increased caspase-3 activity, indicating that apoptosis was responsible for the reduction of the pancreatic islet size. Glucose tolerance tests revealed that transgenic mice expressing the dominant-negative mutant of Elk-1 in pancreatic β-cells displayed impaired glucose tolerance. Thus, we show here for the first time that TCF controls important functions of pancreatic β-cells in vivo. Elk-1 may be considered as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes.},

Here, we aimed to study the role of VDR in β-cells in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Our results indicate that Vdr expression was modulated by glucose in healthy islets and decreased in islets from both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mouse models. In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing VDR in β-cells were protected against streptozotocin-induced diabetes and presented a preserved β-cell mass and a reduction in islet inflammation. Altogether, these results suggest that sustained VDR levels in β-cells may preserve β-cell mass and β-cell function and protect against diabetes.},

Here in, we utilized cDNA microarray and RNA sequencing approaches to investigate the expression pattern of ROR receptors in normal and diabetic human pancreatic islets. Possible correlations between RORs expression and HbA1c levels as well as insulin secretory capacity in isolated human islets were evaluated. The impact of RORB and RORC expression on insulin secretion in INS-1 (832/13) cells was validated as well. While RORA was the highest expressed gene among the three RORs in human islet cells, RORC was the highest expressed in INS-1 cells (832/13) and while RORB was the lowest expressed gene in human islet cells, RORA was the highest expressed in INS-1 cells (832/13). The expression of RORB and RORC was significantly lower in diabetic/hyperglycemic donors as compared with non-diabetic counterparts. Furthermore, while the expression of RORB correlated positively with insulin secretion and negatively with HbA1c, that of RORC correlated negatively with HbA1c. The expression pattern of RORA did not correlate with either of the two parameters. siRNA silencing of RORB or RORC in INS-1 (832/13) cells resulted in a significant downregulation of insulin mRNA expression and insulin secretion. These findings suggest that RORB and RORC are part of the molecular cascade that regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells; and insight that provides for further work on the potential therapeutic utility of RORB and RORC genes in β cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.},

Basic discoveries within the molecular and cellular signaling pathways regulating type I IFN induction and downstream actions have shown the essential role of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) families, respectively. However, the exact biological and immunological functions of these factors have been most clearly revealed through the study of inborn errors of immunity and the resultant infectious phenotypes in humans. The spectrum of human inborn errors of immunity caused by mutations in IRFs and STATs has proven very diverse. These diseases encompass herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and severe influenza in IRF3- and IRF7/IRF9 deficiency, respectively. They also include Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial infection (MSMD) in STAT1 deficiency, through disseminated measles infection associated with STAT2 deficiency, and finally staphylococcal abscesses and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) classically described with Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) in the case of STAT3 deficiency. More recently, increasing focus has been on aspects of autoimmunity and autoinflammation playing an important part in many primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID)s, as exemplified by STAT1 gain-of-function causing CMC and autoimmune thyroiditis, as well as a recently described autoinflammatory syndrome with hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphoproliferation as a result of STAT3 gain-of-function.

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterised by chronic low-grade inflammation, recently referred to as ‘metaflammation’, a relevant factor contributing to the development of both diabetes and its complications. Nonetheless, ‘canonical’ anti-inflammatory drugs do not yield satisfactory results in terms of prevention of diabetes progression and of cardiovascular events, suggesting that the causal mechanisms fostering metaflammation deserve further research to identify new druggable targets. Metaflammation resembles ageing-induced low-grade inflammation, previously referred to as inflammageing, in terms of clinical presentation and the molecular profile, pointing to a common aetiology for both conditions. Along with the mechanisms proposed to fuel inflammageing, here we dissect a plethora of pathological cascades triggered by gluco- and lipotoxicity, converging on candidate phenomena possibly explaining the enduring pro-inflammatory program observed in diabetic tissues, i.e. persistent immune-system stimulation, accumulation of senescent cells, epigenetic rearrangements, and alterations in microbiota composition. We discuss the possibility of harnessing these recent discoveries in future therapies for T2DM. Moreover, we review recent evidence regarding the ability of diets and physical exercise to modulate selected inflammatory pathways relevant for the diabetic pathology. Finally, we examine the latest findings showing putative anti-inflammatory mechanisms of anti-hyperglycaemic agents with proven efficacy against T2DM-induced cardiovascular complications, in order to gain insights into quickly translatable therapeutic approaches.},

In contrast, proliferation is robust in neonatal β cells that are functionally immature as defined by a lower set point for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Here we show that β-cell proliferation and immaturity are linked by tuning expression of physiologically relevant, non-oncogenic levels of c-Myc. Adult β cells induced to replicate adopt gene expression and metabolic profiles resembling those of immature neonatal β that proliferate readily. We directly demonstrate that priming insulin-producing cells to enter the cell cycle promotes a functionally immature phenotype. We suggest that there exists a balance between mature functionality and the ability to expand, as the phenotypic state of the β cell reverts to a less functional one in response to proliferative cues.},

	abstract = {Failure to expand pancreatic β-cells in response to metabolic stress leads to excessive workload resulting in β-cell dysfunction, dedifferentiation, death, and development of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we demonstrate that induction of Myc is required for increased pancreatic β-cell replication and expansion during metabolic stress–induced insulin resistance with short-term high-fat diet (HFD) in young mice. β-Cell–specific Myc knockout mice fail to expand adaptively and show impaired glucose tolerance and β-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, PKCζ, ERK1/2, mTOR, and PP2A are key regulators of the Myc response in this setting. DNA methylation analysis shows hypomethylation of cell cycle genes that are Myc targets in islets from young mice fed with a short-term HFD. Importantly, DNA hypomethylation of Myc response elements does not occur in islets from 1-year-old mice fed with a short-term HFD, impairing both Myc recruitment to cell cycle regulatory genes and β-cell replication. We conclude that Myc is required for metabolic stress–mediated β-cell expansion in young mice, but with aging, Myc upregulation is not sufficient to induce β-cell replication by, at least partially, an epigenetically mediated resistance to Myc action.},

	abstract = {In Wfs1−/−Ay/a islets, in association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, D-site-binding protein (Dbp) expression decreased and Nuclear Factor IL-3 (Nfil3)/E4 Promoter-binding protein 4 (E4bp4) expression increased, leading to reduced DBP transcriptional activity. Similar alterations were observed with chemically-induced ER stress. Transgenic mice expressing E4BP4 under the control of the mouse insulin I gene promoter (MIP), in which E4BP4 in β-cells is expected to compete with DBP for D-box, displayed remarkable glucose intolerance with severely impaired insulin secretion. Basal ATP/ADP ratios in MIP-E4BP4 islets were elevated without the circadian oscillations observed in wild-type islets. Neither elevation of the ATP/ADP ratio nor an intracellular Ca2 + response was observed after glucose stimulation. RNA expressions of genes involved in insulin secretion gradually increase in wild-type islets early in the feeding period. In MIP-E4BP4 islets, however, these increases were not observed. Thus, molecular clock output DBP transcriptional activity, susceptible to ER stress, plays pivotal roles in β-cell priming for insulin release by regulating β-cell metabolism and gene expressions. Because ER stress is also involved in the β-cell failure in more common Type-2 diabetes, understanding the currently identified ER stress-associated mechanisms warrants novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for both rare form and common diabetes.,

              ER stress decreases DBP and increases E4BP4 expressions, reducing overall reduction of DBP transcriptional activity.

              There is a crucial link between ER stress and molecular clock output involved in β-cell dysfunction in diabetes.
            
          
        , Wolfram syndrome, a rare genetic disease caused by the WFS1 mutation, provides a link between ER stress, β-cell failure, and diabetes. ER stress remarkably reduced the transcriptional activity of DBP, a clock out-put gene. Suppression of DBP transcriptional activity in β-cells severely reduced insulin secretion in vivo by regulating β-cell metabolism and gene expressions involved in insulin secretion. β-cell ER stress is induced not only by WFS1 mutations but also in common form type-2 diabetes (T2DM) by mechanisms such as glucoliptoxicity. Modulating of β-cell clock genes can be therapeutic targets preventing and remedying β-cell failure in Wolfram syndrome and T2DM.,

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease with onset from early childhood. The insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The disease is challenging to study mechanistically in humans because it is not possible to biopsy the pancreatic islets and the disease is most active prior to the time of clinical diagnosis. The NOD mouse model, with many similarities to, but also some significant differences from human diabetes, provides an opportunity, in a single in-bred genotype, to explore pathogenic mechanisms in molecular detail. The pleiotropic cytokine IFN-gamma is believed to contribute to pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Evidence of IFN-gamma signaling in the islets, including activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and upregulation of MHC class I, are hallmarks of the disease. IFN-gamma has a proinflammatory role that is important for homing of autoreactive T cells into islets and direct recognition of beta cells by CD8+ T cells. We recently showed that IFN-gamma also controls proliferation of autoreactive T cells. Therefore, inhibition of IFN-gamma does not prevent type 1 diabetes and is unlikely to be a good therapeutic target. In this manuscript we review the contrasting roles of IFN-gamma in driving inflammation and regulating the number of antigen specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes. We also discuss the potential to use JAK inhibitors as therapy for type 1 diabetes, to inhibit both cytokine-mediated inflammation and proliferation of T cells.},

	abstract = {IFNα is a cytokine essential to a vast array of immunologic processes. Its induction early in the innate immune response provides a priming mechanism that orchestrates numerous subsequent pathways in innate and adaptive immunity. Despite its beneficial effects in viral infections IFNα has been reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases including autoimmune thyroid disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cholangitis, and recently emerged as a major cytokine that triggers Type 1 Diabetes. In this review, we dissect the role of IFNα in T1D, focusing on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Evidence from human and mouse studies indicates that IFNα plays a key role in enhancing islet expression of HLA-I in patients with T1D, thereby increasing autoantigen presentation and beta cell activation of autoreactive cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocytes. The binding of IFNα to its receptor induces the secretion of chemokines, attracting monocytes, T lymphocytes, and NK cells to the infected tissue triggering autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Furthermore, IFNα impairs insulin production through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as by impairing mitochondrial function. Due to its central role in the early phases of beta cell death, targeting IFNα and its pathways in genetically predisposed individuals may represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy in the very early stages of T1D.},

However, the exact mechanisms of IFN-α that facilitate the pathogenesis of T1D are not fully understood. To explore the mechanism of IFN-α on the immune system and islets, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were injected with IFN-α and the progression of autoimmune insulitis was assessed by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis. Transcriptional profiling of islets treated with IFN-α was explored by RNA-seq. IFN-α induced antigen presentation was evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence, and key transcription factors were inhibited by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Our data show that IFN-α contributed to the progression of autoimmune insulitis in NOD mice by promoting the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. IFN-α upregulated antigen presentation related genes MHC I, TAP1, B2M, PSMB8, NLRC5 and transcriptional regulator STAT1, STAT2, IRF7 at a time and dose-dependent manner. The silence of STAT1 or STAT2 both weakened IFN-α-induced increase of antigen presenting related molecules. IRF7 was also merely influenced by STAT1 silence. The knockdown of IRF7 decreased the IFN-α induced expressions of TAP1, PSMB8 and MHC I and prevented the expression of STAT2 but not STAT1. Our study demonstrated that STAT1-IRF7-MHC I complex axis were crucial for IFN-α signalling in islets, and created positive feedback through IRF7-STAT2 cascade amplifying signals which accelerated the process of T1D.},

The initial response to IFNα is characterized by chromatin remodeling, followed by changes in transcriptional and translational regulation.

This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may expand antigens presented by beta cells to the immune system.

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by pancreatic islet inflammation (insulitis) and specific pancreatic β-cell destruction by an immune attack. Although the precise underlying mechanisms leading to the autoimmune assault remain poorly understood, it is well accepted that insulitis takes place in the context of a conflicting dialogue between pancreatic β-cells and the immune cells. Moreover, both host genetic background (i.e., candidate genes) and environmental factors (e.g., viral infections) contribute to this inadequate dialogue. Accumulating evidence indicates that type I interferons (IFNs), cytokines that are crucial for both innate and adaptive immune responses, act as key links between environmental and genetic risk factors in the development of T1D. This chapter summarizes some relevant pathways involved in β-cell dysfunction and death, and briefly reviews how enteroviral infections and genetic susceptibility can impact insulitis. Moreover, we present the current evidence showing that, in β-cells, type I IFN signaling pathway activation leads to several outcomes, such as long-lasting major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I hyperexpression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, epigenetic changes, and induction of posttranscriptional as well as posttranslational modifications. MHC class I overexpression, when combined with ER stress and posttranscriptional/posttranslational modifications, might lead to sustained neoantigen presentation to immune system and β-cell apoptosis. This knowledge supports the concept that type I IFNs are implicated in the early stages of T1D pathogenesis. Finally, we highlight the promising therapeutic avenues for T1D treatment directed at type I IFN signaling pathway.},

However, events that define the pathogenesis of human T1D have remained elusive. This gap in our knowledge results from the complex interaction between genetics, the immune system, and environmental factors that precipitate T1D in humans. A link between genetics, the immune system, and environmental factors are type 1 interferons (T1-IFNs). These cytokines are well known for inducing antiviral factors that limit infection by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Further, several T1D genetic risk loci are within genes that link innate and adaptive immune cell responses to T1-IFN. An additional clue that links T1-IFN to T1D is that these cytokines are a known constituent of the autoinflammatory milieu within the pancreas of patients with T1D. The presence of IFNα/β is correlated with characteristic MHC class I (MHC-I) hyperexpression found in the islets of patients with T1D, suggesting that T1-IFNs modulate the cross-talk between autoreactive cytotoxic CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$ T lymphocytes and insulin-producing pancreatic β cells.

	abstract = {Selective and controlled expansion of endogenous β-cells has been pursued as a potential therapy for diabetes. Ideally, such therapies would preserve feedback control of β-cell proliferation to avoid excessive β-cell expansion and an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Here, we identified a regulator of β-cell proliferation whose inactivation results in controlled β-cell expansion: the protein deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2). Sirt2 deletion in β-cells of mice increased β-cell proliferation during hyperglycemia with little effect in homeostatic conditions, indicating preservation of feedback control of β-cell mass. SIRT2 restrains proliferation of human islet β-cells cultured in glucose concentrations above the glycemic set point, demonstrating conserved SIRT2 function. Analysis of acetylated proteins in islets treated with a SIRT2 inhibitor revealed that SIRT2 deacetylates enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, dampening the adaptive increase in oxygen consumption during hyperglycemia. At the transcriptomic level, Sirt2 inactivation has context-dependent effects on β-cells, with Sirt2 controlling how β-cells interpret hyperglycemia as a stress. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle that systemic administration of a GLP1-coupled Sirt2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide achieves β-cell selective Sirt2 inactivation and stimulates β-cell proliferation under hyperglycemic conditions. Overall, these studies identify a therapeutic strategy for increasing β-cell mass in diabetes without circumventing feedback control of β-cell proliferation.},

	abstract = {Geroscience, the new interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the relationship between aging and chronic age-related diseases (ARDs) and geriatric syndromes (GSs), is based on epidemiological evidence and experimental data that aging is the major risk factor for such pathologies and assumes that aging and ARDs/GSs share a common set of basic biological mechanisms. A consequence is that the primary target of medicine is to combat aging instead of any single ARD/GSs one by one, as favored by the fragmentation into hundreds of specialties and sub-specialties. If the same molecular and cellular mechanisms underpin both aging and ARDs/GSs, a major question emerges: which is the difference, if any, between aging and ARDs/GSs? The hypothesis that ARDs and GSs such as frailty can be conceptualized as accelerated aging will be discussed by analyzing in particular frailty, sarcopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson as well as Down syndrome as an example of progeroid syndrome. According to this integrated view, aging and ARDs/GSs become part of a continuum where precise boundaries do not exist and the two extremes are represented by centenarians, who largely avoided or postponed most ARDs/GSs and are characterized by decelerated aging, and patients who suffered one or more severe ARDs in their 60s, 70s, and 80s and show signs of accelerated aging, respectively. In between these two extremes, there is a continuum of intermediate trajectories representing a sort of gray area. Thus, clinically different, classical ARDs/GSs are, indeed, the result of peculiar combinations of alterations regarding the same, limited set of basic mechanisms shared with the aging process. Whether an individual will follow a trajectory of accelerated or decelerated aging will depend on his/her genetic background interacting lifelong with environmental and lifestyle factors. If ARDs and GSs are manifestations of accelerated aging, it is urgent to identify markers capable of distinguishing between biological and chronological age to identify subjects at higher risk of developing ARDs and GSs. To this aim, we propose the use of DNA methylation, N-glycans profiling, and gut microbiota composition to complement the available disease-specific markers.},

Yet, contemporary clustering and dimensionality reduction tools alone are insufficient to analyze or reproduce analyses across large numbers of samples, batches, or experiments. Moreover, approaches that allow for the integration of data across batches or experiments are not well incorporated into computational toolkits to allow for streamlined workflows. Here we present Spectre, an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of HD cytometry data from different batches or experiments. Spectre streamlines the analytical stages of raw data pre-processing, batch alignment, data integration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and population labelling, as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. Critically, the fundamental data structures used within Spectre, along with the implementation of machine learning classifiers, allow for the scalable analysis of very large HD datasets, generated by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, or spectral cytometry. Using open and flexible data structures, Spectre can also be used to analyze data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing or HD imaging technologies, such as Imaging Mass Cytometry. The simple, clear, and modular design of analysis workflows allow these tools to be used by bioinformaticians and laboratory scientists alike. Spectre is available as an R package or Docker container. R code is available on Github (https://github.com/immunedynamics/spectre).},

Biochemical events involving JAK/STAT proteins that control transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were the first to be identified and are referred to as "canonical" signaling. Subsequent identification of JAK/STAT-independent signaling pathways, critical for ISG transcription and/or mRNA translation, are denoted as "non-canonical" or "non-classical" pathways.

Growing evidence suggests that components of the innate immune system, and especially macrophages, play a crucial role in regulating islet homeostasis. Yet, the phenotypes and functions of islet macrophages in physiology and during T2D have only started to attract attention and remain unclear.

Here we integrate information from measurements of chromatin accessibility, gene expression and function in single beta cells with genetic association data to nominate disease-causal gene regulatory changes in T2D. Using machine learning on chromatin accessibility data from 34 nondiabetic, pre-T2D and T2D donors, we identify two transcriptionally and functionally distinct beta cell subtypes that undergo an abundance shift during T2D progression. Subtype-defining accessible chromatin is enriched for T2D risk variants, suggesting a causal contribution of subtype identity to T2D. Both beta cell subtypes exhibit activation of a stress-response transcriptional program and functional impairment in T2D, which is probably induced by the T2D-associated metabolic environment. Our findings demonstrate the power of multimodal single-cell measurements combined with machine learning for characterizing mechanisms of complex diseases.},

Translating these risk variants into mechanistic insights requires detailed maps of gene regulation in disease-relevant cell types2. Here we combined two approaches: a genome-wide association study of type 1 diabetes (T1D) using 520,580 samples, and the identification of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) of 131,554 nuclei. Risk variants for T1D were enriched in cCREs that were active in T cells and other cell types, including acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas. Risk variants at multiple T1D signals overlapped with exocrine-specific cCREs that were linked to genes with exocrine-specific expression. At the CFTR locus, the T1D risk variant rs7795896 mapped to a ductal-specific cCRE that regulated CFTR; the risk allele reduced transcription factor binding, enhancer activity and CFTR expression in ductal cells. These findings support a role for the exocrine pancreas in the pathogenesis of T1D and highlight the power of large-scale genome-wide association studies and single-cell epigenomics for understanding the cellular origins of complex disease.},

Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptome, single-nuclei chromatin accessibility, and cell-type specific 3D genome profiles from human islets and identify Type II Diabetes (T2D)-associated β-cell heterogeneity at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. We develop a computational method to explicitly dissect the intra-donor and inter-donor heterogeneity between single β-cells, which reflect distinct mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis. Integrative transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis identifies HNF1A as a principal driver of intra-donor heterogeneity between β-cells from the same donors; HNF1A expression is also reduced in β-cells from T2D donors. Interestingly, HNF1A activity in single β-cells is significantly associated with lower Na+ currents and we nominate a HNF1A target, FXYD2, as the primary mitigator.

Cultured human islets and fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified human β-cells were used to study the regulation of IL-1β expression by glucose and IL-1β., Results: Gene array analysis of RNA from β-cells of individuals with T2DM revealed increased expression of IL-1β mRNA. Real-time PCR confirmed increased IL-1β expression in six of 10 T2DM samples, with minimal or no expression in nine control samples. In cultured human islets, IL-1β mRNA and protein expression was induced by high glucose and IL-1β autostimulation and decreased by the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1Ra. The glucose response was negatively correlated with basal IL-1β expression levels. Autostimulation was transient and nuclear factor-κB dependent. Glucose-induced IL-1β was biologically active and stimulated IL-8 release. Low picogram per milliliter concentrations of IL-1β up-regulated inflammatory factors IL-8 and IL-6., Conclusion: Evidence that IL-1β mRNA expression is up-regulated in β-cells of patients with T2DM is presented, and glucose-promoted IL-1β autostimulation may be a possible contributor., Pancreatic β-cells obtained by laser capture microdissection from individuals with type 2 diabetes display elevated expression of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation is considered a key mechanism leading to type 2 diabetes, but dietary exposures that lead to inflammation and diabetes are largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the relation between a dietary pattern associated with biomarkers of inflammation and the incidence of type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN: We conducted a nested case-control study of 656 cases of type 2 diabetes and 694 controls among women in the Nurses' Health Study and 2 prospective cohort studies of 35,340 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 89,311 women in the Nurses' Health Study II who were followed for incident diabetes.
RESULTS: Through the use of reduced rank regression, we identified a dietary pattern that was strongly related to inflammatory markers in the nested case-control study. This pattern, which was high in sugar-sweetened soft drinks, refined grains, diet soft drinks, and processed meat but low in wine, coffee, cruciferous vegetables, and yellow vegetables, was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio comparing extreme quintiles: 3.09; 95\% CI: 1.99, 4.79). We identified 1517 incident cases of confirmed type 2 diabetes in the Nurses' Health Study (458,991 person-years) and 724 incident cases in the Nurses' Health Study II (701,155 person-years). After adjustment for body mass index and other potential lifestyle confounders, the relative risks comparing extreme quintiles of the pattern were 2.56 (95\% CI: 2.10, 3.12; P for trend {\textless} 0.001) in the Nurses' Health Study and 2.93 (95\% CI: 2.18, 3.92; P for trend {\textless} 0.001) in the Nurses' Health Study II.
CONCLUSION: The dietary pattern identified may increase chronic inflammation and raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

As individuals age, T cells are particularly susceptible to changes, making them one of the most affected immune subsets. These changes can have significant implications for age-related dysregulations, including the development of low-grade inflammation – a hallmark of aging known as inflammaging. In this review, we first present age-related changes in the functionality of the T cell compartment, including dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine production and cytotoxicity. Next, we discuss how these changes can contribute to the development and maintenance of inflammaging. Furthermore, we will summarize the mechanisms through which age-related changes in T cells may drive abnormal physiological outcomes.},

Tissue stress or malfunction similarly induces an adaptive response, which is referred to here as para-inflammation. This response relies mainly on tissue-resident macrophages and is intermediate between the basal homeostatic state and a classic inflammatory response.

Considering lipid metabolism, excess adiposity with increased lipotoxicity leads to various age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the multifaceted nature and complexities of lipid metabolism make it difficult to delineate its exact mechanism and role during aging. With advances in genetic engineering techniques, recent studies have demonstrated that changes in lipid metabolism are associated with aging and age-related diseases. Lipid accumulation and impaired fatty acid utilization in organs are associated with pathophysiological phenotypes of aging. Changes in adipokine levels contribute to aging by modulating changes in systemic metabolism and inflammation. Advances in lipidomic techniques have identified changes in lipid profiles that are associated with aging. Although it remains unclear how lipid metabolism is regulated during aging, or how lipid metabolites impact aging, evidence suggests a dynamic role for lipid metabolism and its metabolites as active participants of signaling pathways and regulators of gene expression. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of lipid metabolism in aging, including established findings and recent approaches.},

In the elderly, a sterile, chronic and low-grade systemic inflammation known as “inflammaging” is linked with many age-associated diseases. Considering sarcopenia as a loss of strength and mass of skeletal muscle related to aging, correlations between these two terms have been proposed. Better knowledge of the immune system players in skeletal muscle would help to elucidate their implications in sarcopenia. Characterizing the activators of damage sensors and the downstream effectors explains the inference with skeletal muscle performance. Sarcopenia has also been linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Implications of inflammatory signals from these diseases negatively affect skeletal muscle. Autophagic mechanisms are closely related with the inflammasome, as autophagy eliminates stress signaling sent by damage organelles, but also acts with an immunomodulatory function affecting immune cells and cytokine release. The use of melatonin, an antioxidant, ROS scavenger and immune and autophagy modulator, or senotherapeutic compounds targeting senescent cells could represent strategies to counteract inflammation. This review aims to present the many factors regulating skeletal muscle inflammaging and their major implications in order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in sarcopenia.},

	abstract = {Aging is characterized by systemic chronic inflammation, which is accompanied by cellular senescence, immunosenescence, organ dysfunction, and age-related diseases. Given the multidimensional complexity of aging, there is an urgent need for a systematic organization of inflammaging through dimensionality reduction. Factors secreted by senescent cells, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), promote chronic inflammation and can induce senescence in normal cells. At the same time, chronic inflammation accelerates the senescence of immune cells, resulting in weakened immune function and an inability to clear senescent cells and inflammatory factors, which creates a vicious cycle of inflammation and senescence. Persistently elevated inflammation levels in organs such as the bone marrow, liver, and lungs cannot be eliminated in time, leading to organ damage and aging-related diseases. Therefore, inflammation has been recognized as an endogenous factor in aging, and the elimination of inflammation could be a potential strategy for anti-aging. Here we discuss inflammaging at the molecular, cellular, organ, and disease levels, and review current aging models, the implications of cutting-edge single cell technologies, as well as anti-aging strategies. Since preventing and alleviating aging-related diseases and improving the overall quality of life are the ultimate goals of aging research, our review highlights the critical features and potential mechanisms of inflammation and aging, along with the latest developments and future directions in aging research, providing a theoretical foundation for novel and practical anti-aging strategies.},

We propose that impaired protein homeostasis due to compromised lysosomal degradation (micro-autophagy) might promote aberrant ER stress response and inflammation in aging adipose tissue. Using C57BL/6 mouse model, we demonstrate that adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from old (18-20 months) mice have reduced expression of autophagy markers as compared to the younger (4-6 months) cohort. Elevated expressions of ER-stress marker CHOP and autophagy substrate SQSTM1/p62 are observed in old SVFs compared to young, when treated with either vehicle or with thapsigargin (Tg), an ER stress inducer. Treatment with bafilomycin A1 (Baf), a vacuolar-type H (+)-ATPase, or Tg elevated expressions of CHOP, and SQSTM1/p62 and LC-3-II, in 3T3-L1-preadipocytes. We also demonstrate impaired autophagy activity in old SVFs by analyzing increased accumulation of autophagy substrates LC3-II and p62. Compromised autophagy activity in old SVFs is correlated with enhanced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1. Finally, SVFs from calorie restricted old mice (CR-O) have shown enhanced autophagy activity compared to ad libitum fed old mice (AL-O). Our results support the notion that diminished autophagy activity with aging contributes to increased adipose tissue ER stress and inflammation.},

Inflammation in adipose tissue, mainly evidenced by increased accumulation and proinflammatory polarization of T cells and macrophages, has been well-documented in obesity and may contribute to the associated metabolic dysfunctions including insulin resistance. Studies show that increased inflammation, including inflammation in adipose tissue, also occurs in aging, so-called “inflamm-aging.” Aging-associated inflammation in adipose tissue has some similarities but also differences compared to obesity-related inflammation. In particular, conventional T cells are elevated in adipose tissue in both obesity and aging and have been implicated in metabolic functions in obesity. However, the changes and also possibly functions of regulatory T cells (Treg) in adipose tissue are different in aging and obesity. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in research on the changes of these immune cells in adipose tissue with aging and obesity and discuss their possible contributions to metabolism and the potential of these immune cells as novel therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases associated with aging or obesity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ageing, like obesity, is often associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory processes resulting in morbidity from diseases characterised by poor metabolic control, insulin insensitivity, and inflammation. Ageing populations also exhibit a decline in immune competence referred to as immunosenescence, which contributes to, or might be driven by chronic, low-grade inflammation termed “inflammageing”. In recent years, animal and human studies have started to uncover a role for immune cells within the stromal fraction of adipose tissue in driving the health complications that come with obesity, but relatively little work has been conducted in the context of immunometabolic adipose function in ageing. It is now clear that aberrant immune function within adipose tissue in obesity—including an accumulation of pro-inflammatory immune cell populations—plays a major role in the development of systemic chronic, low-grade inflammation, and limiting the function of adipocytes leading to an impaired fat handling capacity. As a consequence, these changes increase the chance of multiorgan dysfunction and disease onset. Considering the important role of the immune system in obesity-associated metabolic and inflammatory diseases, it is critically important to further understand the interplay between immunological processes and adipose tissue function, establishing whether this interaction contributes to age-associated immunometabolic dysfunction and inflammation. Therefore, the aim of this article is to summarise how the interaction between adipose tissue and the immune system changes with ageing, likely contributing to the age-associated increase in inflammatory activity and loss of metabolic control. To understand the potential mechanisms involved, parallels will be drawn to the current knowledge derived from investigations in obesity. We also highlight gaps in research and propose potential future directions based on the current evidence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

One such assay was launched in 2016 by the US-based company 10x Genomics Inc. Utilizing the power of the single cell on a large scale (Zheng et al. Nat Commun 8:14049, 2017)—capturing thousands of cells at once—has shaped life sciences ever since and allowed researchers to discover new insights within their respective fields of study such as oncology, neurobiology, and immunology (among others). Obtaining high-data quality is the key to being able to make these meaningful discoveries, which in turn is directly linked to the quality of the initial cell (or nuclei) suspension that is used to load the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression assay. A successful workflow relies on a cell suspension which is fully dissociated, extremely clean, and of high viability. While the workflow itself has been detailed elsewhere (De Simone et al. Methods Mol Biol 1979:87–110, 2019), in this chapter we will focus on the importance of the quality of the initial cell suspension, as well as common mistakes that can occur while running a Single Cell Gene Expression assay. The descriptions of these tips and tricks refer to the current version of the 10x Genomics User Guide (Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1 Chemistry Dual Index). https://support10xgenomicscom/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index) which can be downloaded from the Support section on the 10x Genomics website (10x Genomics website. https://www10xgenomicscom).

Some of the dyes that were used for generations are no longer available, and chemicals used in some older methods are now considered hazardous. Additionally, the histotechnologists and pathologists familiar with these techniques are now retiring and leaving the field, resulting in a loss of experience. To provide a sense of the rich legacy of histopathological analysis, this article reviews the development of special stains in histopathology, describes staining techniques, and discusses the wide range of applications. Numerous staining techniques mentioned in this article were originally published many years ago, some in obscure journals in foreign countries, and are not readily available to practicing histotechnologists.

Here we found that following streptozotocin (STZ)-induced beta-cell death, mouse islet macrophages had increased Igf1 expression, decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression, and transcriptome changes consistent with macrophages undergoing efferocytosis and having an enhanced state of metabolism. Macrophages were the major, if not sole, contributors to islet insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that macrophages can maintain insulin secretion in vivo following beta-cell death with no effects on islet cell turnover. IGF-1 neutralization during STZ treatment decreased insulin secretion without affecting islet cell apoptosis or proliferation. Interestingly, high-fat diet (HFD) combined with STZ further skewed islet macrophages to a reparative state. Finally, islet macrophages from db/db mice also expressed decreased proinflammatory cytokines and increased Igf1 mRNA. These data have important implications for islet biology and pathology and show that islet macrophages preserve their reparative state following beta-cell death even during HFD feeding and severe hyperglycemia.},

VEGF-A induction dramatically increased the number of intra-islet ECs but led to β cell loss. After withdrawal of the VEGF-A stimulus, β cell mass, function, and islet structure normalized as a result of a robust, but transient, burst in proliferation of pre-existing β cells. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (MΦs) recruited to the site of β cell injury were crucial for the β cell proliferation, which was independent of pancreatic location and circulating factors such as glucose.

Islet remodeling supports this compensation, but its drivers remain poorly understood. Infiltrating macrophages have been implicated in late-stage type 2 diabetes, but relatively little is known on islet resident macrophages, especially during compensatory hyperinsulinemia. We hypothesized that islet resident macrophages would contribute to islet vascular remodeling and hyperinsulinemia during diabetes, the failure of which results in a rapid progression to frank diabetes. We used chemical (clodronate), genetics (CD169-diphtheria toxin receptor mice), or antibody-mediated (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor α) macrophage ablation methods in diabetic (db/db) and diet-induced models of compensatory hyperinsulinemia to investigate the role of macrophages in islet remodeling. We transplanted islets devoid of macrophages into naïve diabetic mice and assessed the impact on islet vascularization. With the use of the above methods, we showed that macrophage depletion significantly and consistently compromised islet remodeling in terms of size, vascular density, and insulin secretion capacity. Depletion of islet macrophages reduced VEGF-A secretion in both human and mouse islets ex vivo, and this functionally translated to delayed revascularization upon transplantation in vivo. We revealed that islet resident macrophages were associated with islet remodeling and increased insulin secretion during diabetes. This suggests utility in harnessing islet macrophages during this phase to promote islet vascularization, remodeling, and insulin secretion.},

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Tissue-resident macrophages sense the microenvironment and respond by producing signals that act locally to maintain a stable tissue state. It is now known that pancreatic islets contain their own unique resident macrophages, which have been shown to promote proliferation of the insulin-secreting beta cell. However, it is unclear how beta cells communicate with islet-resident macrophages. Here we hypothesised that islet macrophages sense changes in islet activity by detecting signals derived from beta cells.
METHODS: To investigate how islet-resident macrophages respond to cues from the microenvironment, we generated mice expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator in myeloid cells. We produced living pancreatic slices from these mice and used them to monitor macrophage responses to stimulation of acinar, neural and endocrine cells.
RESULTS: Islet-resident macrophages expressed functional purinergic receptors, making them exquisite sensors of interstitial ATP levels. Indeed, islet-resident macrophages responded selectively to ATP released locally from beta cells that were physiologically activated with high levels of glucose. Because ATP is co-released with insulin and is exclusively secreted by beta cells, the activation of purinergic receptors on resident macrophages facilitates their awareness of beta cell secretory activity.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that islet macrophages detect ATP as a proxy signal for the activation state of beta cells. Sensing beta cell activity may allow macrophages to adjust the secretion of factors to promote a stable islet composition and size.},

	abstract = {Macrophages populate the mesenchymal compartment of all organs during embryogenesis and have been shown to support tissue organogenesis and regeneration by regulating remodeling of the extracellular microenvironment. Whether this mesenchymal component can also dictate select developmental decisions in epithelia is unknown. Here, using the embryonic pancreatic epithelium as model system, we show that macrophages drive the epithelium to execute two developmentally important choices, i.e. the exit from cell cycle and the acquisition of a migratory phenotype. We demonstrate that these developmental decisions are effectively imparted by macrophages activated toward an M2 fetal-like functional state, and involve modulation of the adhesion receptor NCAM and an uncommon “paired-less” isoform of the transcription factor PAX6 in the epithelium. Over-expression of this PAX6 variant in pancreatic epithelia controls both cell motility and cell cycle progression in a gene-dosage dependent fashion. Importantly, induction of these phenotypes in embryonic pancreatic transplants by M2 macrophages in vivo is associated with an increased frequency of endocrine-committed cells emerging from ductal progenitor pools. These results identify M2 macrophages as key effectors capable of coordinating epithelial cell cycle withdrawal and cell migration, two events critical to pancreatic progenitors' delamination and progression toward their differentiated fates.},

	abstract = {Paraphrasing the Swiss physician and father of toxicology Paracelsus (1493–1541) on chemical agents used as therapeutics, “the dose makes the poison,” it is now realized that this aptly applies to the calorigenic nutrients. The case here is the pancreatic islet β-cell presented with excessive levels of nutrients such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids. The short-term effects these nutrients exert on the β-cell are enhanced insulin biosynthesis and secretion and changes in glucose sensitivity. However, chronic fuel surfeit triggers additional compensatory and adaptive mechanisms by β-cells to cope with the increased insulin demand or to protect itself. When these mechanisms fail, toxicity due to the nutrient surplus ensues, leading to β-cell dysfunction, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis. The terms glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and glucolipotoxicity have been widely used, but there is some confusion as to what they mean precisely and which is most appropriate for a given situation. Here we address the gluco-, lipo-, and glucolipo-toxicities in β-cells by assessing the evidence both for and against each of them. We also discuss potential mechanisms and defend the view that many of the identified “toxic” effects of nutrient excess, which may also include amino acids, are in fact beneficial adaptive processes. In addition, candidate fuel-excess detoxification pathways are evaluated. Finally, we propose that a more general term should be used for the in vivo situation of overweight-associated type 2 diabetes reflecting both the adaptive and toxic processes to mixed calorigenic nutrients excess: “nutrient-induced metabolic stress” or, in brief, “nutri-stress.”},

We developed a robust computational biology framework for cell type annotation. Using this framework, we show that α- and β-cells from children exhibit less well-defined gene signatures than those in adults. Remarkably, α- and β-cells from donors with type 2 diabetes have expression profiles with features seen in children, indicating a partial dedifferentiation process. We also examined a naturally proliferating α-cell from a healthy adult, for which pathway analysis indicated activation of the cell cycle and repression of checkpoint control pathways. Importantly, this replicating α-cell exhibited activated Sonic hedgehog signaling, a pathway not previously known to contribute to human α-cell proliferation.

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by β-cell dedifferentiation, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of the current study was to explore the mechanisms of β-cell dedifferentiation with and without long-term control of calorie intake. We used a diabetes mouse model (db/db) to analyze the changes in the expression levels of β-cell-specific transcription factors (TFs) and functional factors with long-term caloric restriction (CR). Our results showed that chronic euglycemia was maintained in the db/db mice with long-term CR intervention, and β-cell dedifferentiation was significantly reduced. The expression of Glut2, Pdx1, and Nkx6.1 was reversed, while MafA expression was significantly increased with long-term CR. GLP-1 pathway was reactivated with long-term CR. Our work showed that the course of β-cell dedifferentiation can intervene by long-term control of calorie intake. Key β-cell-specific TFs and functional factors play important roles in maintaining β-cell differentiation. Targeting these factors could optimize T2D therapies.},

	abstract = {Macrophages are highly heterogeneous and plastic immune cells with peculiar characteristics dependent on their origin and microenvironment. Following pathogen infection or damage, circulating monocytes can be recruited in different tissues where they differentiate into macrophages. Stimuli present in the surrounding milieu induce the polarisation of macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory profile, mediating inflammatory or homeostatic responses, respectively. However, macrophages can also derive from embryonic hematopoietic precursors and reside in specific tissues, actively participating in the development and the homeostasis in physiological conditions. Pancreatic islet resident macrophages are present from the prenatal stages onwards and show specific surface markers and functions. They localise in close proximity to β-cells, being exquisite sensors of their secretory ability and viability. Over the years, the crucial role of macrophages in β-cell differentiation and homeostasis has been highlighted. In addition, macrophages are emerging as central players in the initiation of autoimmune insulitis in type 1 diabetes and in the low-grade chronic inflammation characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. The present work reviews the current knowledge in the field, with a particular focus on the mechanisms of communication between β-cells and macrophages that have been described so far.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pancreatic β cell dysfunction and death are central in the pathogenesis of most if not all forms of diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying β cell failure is important to develop β cell protective approaches.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here we review the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling in β cell failure in monogenic and polygenic forms of diabetes. There is substantial evidence for the presence of endoplasmic reticulum stress in β cells in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Direct evidence for the importance of this stress response is provided by an increasing number of monogenic forms of diabetes. In particular, mutations in the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response provide insight into its importance for human β cell function and survival. The knowledge gained from different rodent models is reviewed. More disease- and patient-relevant models, using human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into β cells, will further advance our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, we review the therapeutic modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and signaling in β cells.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic β cells are sensitive to excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress and dysregulated eIF2α phosphorylation, as indicated by transcriptome data, monogenic forms of diabetes and pharmacological studies. This should be taken into consideration when devising new therapeutic approaches for diabetes.},

	abstract = {The beta-cell biochemical mechanisms that account for the compensatory hyperfunction with insulin resistance (so-called beta-cell adaptation) are unknown. We investigated glucose metabolism in isolated islets from 10-12-week-old Zucker fatty (ZF) and Zucker lean (ZL) rats (results expressed per mg/islet of protein). ZF rats were obese, hyperlipidemic, and normoglycemic. They had a 3.8-fold increased beta-cell mass along with 3-10-fold increases in insulin secretion to various stimuli during pancreas perfusion despite insulin content per milligram of beta-cells being only one-third that of ZL rats. Islet glucose metabolism (utilization and oxidation) was 1.5-2-fold increased in the ZF islets despite pyruvate dehydrogenase activity being 30\% lowered compared with the ZL islets. The reason was increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and the malate-pyruvate and citrate-pyruvate shuttles based on the following observations (\% ZL islets): increased V(max) of PC (160\%), malate dehydrogenase (170\%), and malic enzyme (275\%); elevated concentrations of oxaloacetate (150\%), malate (250\%), citrate (140\%), and pyruvate (250\%); and 2-fold increased release of malate from isolated mitochondria. Inhibition of PC by 5 mm phenylacetic acid markedly lowered glucose-induced insulin secretion in ZF and ZL islets. Thus, our results suggest that PC and the pyruvate shuttles are increased in ZF islets, and this accounts for glucose mitochondrial metabolism being increased when pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is reduced. As the anaplerosis pathways are implicated in glucose-induced insulin secretion and the synthesis of glucose-derived lipid and amino acids, our results highlight the potential importance of PC and the anaplerosis pathways in the enhanced insulin secretion and beta-cell growth that characterize beta-cell adaptation to insulin resistance.},

	doi = {10.1172/JCI113339},
	abstract = {The pattern of endogenous insulin secretion over a 24-h period, which included three mixed meals, was evaluated in 14 normal volunteers and 15 obese subjects. Insulin secretory rates were calculated from plasma C-peptide levels using individually derived C-peptide kinetic parameters and a validated open two-compartment model of peripheral C-peptide kinetics. Insulin secretion rates were consistently elevated in the obese subjects under basal conditions (11.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.5 nmol/h) and in the 4 h after breakfast (139 +/- 15 vs. 63 +/- 5 nmol/4 h, P less than 0.001), lunch (152 +/- 16 vs. 67 +/- 5 nmol/4 h, P less than 0.001), and dinner (145 +/- 18 vs. 65 +/- 6 nmol/4 h, P less than 0.001). In the normal subjects, basal insulin secretion represented 50 +/- 2.1\% of total 24-h insulin production, insulin secretion returned to baseline between meals, and equal quantities of insulin were secreted in the 4 h after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, despite the fact that subjects consumed half the number of calories at breakfast compared to lunch and dinner. Overall glucose responses were also similar after the three meals. In contrast, the pattern of insulin secretion in obese subjects was largely normal, albeit set at a higher level. However, the insulin secretion rate after meals did not return to baseline, and the secretion rate immediately before lunch (350.5 +/- 81.9 pmol/min) and dinner (373.6 +/- 64.8 pmol/min) was considerably higher than the secretion rate immediately before breakfast (175.5 +/- 18.5 pmol/min). In these overweight subjects, the glucose response after lunch was lower than after dinner. Analysis of individual 24-h insulin secretory profiles in the normal subjects revealed that insulin secretion was pulsatile. On average 11.1 +/- 0.5 pulses were produced in each 24-h period. The most prevalent temporal distribution of postmeal secretory pulses was two pulses after breakfast and three pulses after both lunch and dinner. Insulin secretion was also pulsatile during the period without meal stimuli: 3.9 +/- 0.3 pulses occurred during the period of overnight sampling and in the 3-h period before ingestion of the breakfast meal. In the obese subjects, the number and timing of secretory pulses was similar to those of normal volunteers, although the amplitude of the pulses was significantly greater. In both groups of subjects, greater than 80\% of insulin pulses were concomitant with a pulse in glucose concentration in the postmeal period. The concomitancy rate was significantly lower in the interval without the meal stimuli, averaging 47\% in both groups. Thus in obesity, although hypersecretion of insulin can be documented, the temporal pattern of secretion i s largely unaltered, which suggests that the functioning beta cell mass is enhance, but normal regulatory mechanisms influencing secretion are still operative.},

	abstract = {Psoriasis is a T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th17-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease, characterised by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Psoriasis and cardiovascular disease share similar pathogenic mechanisms such as vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome. 25-hydroxy vitamin D is an immune-regulatory hormone, with the ability to reduce cellular proliferation in psoriasis. Ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a marker of oxidative stress. This study examined 25-hydroxy vitamin D, IMA and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with psoriasis, in comparison with healthy controls and their possible association with disease severity. A total of 43 cases of psoriasis and 43 controls were included in this cross-sectional study, and severity grading was performed according to psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scoring. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D, IMA and hs-CRP were evaluated in all study subjects. In psoriasis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D showed a significant decline, while hs-CRP and IMA levels were significantly elevated, as compared with controls. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D showed a significant negative correlation with PASI score. hs-CRP and IMA showed a significant positive correlation with PASI score. Significant negative correlation was observed between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hs-CRP; 25-hydroxy vitamin D and IMA levels in psoriasis. The results indicate that psoriasis is associated with significantly lowered 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, along with increased systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, especially in severe disease. Thus, vitamin D supplementation might reduce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress and help in delaying the pathogenesis of co-morbidities associated with psoriasis.},

Islet macrophages expressed an activation signature with high expression of Tnf, Il1b, and MHC-II at both the transcript and protein levels. These features are common with barrier macrophages of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, injection of lipopolysaccharide induced rapid inflammatory gene expression, indicating that blood stimulants are accessible to the macrophages and that these macrophages can sense them. In NOD mice, the autoimmune process imparted an increased inflammatory signature, including elevated expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors and an oxidative response. The elevated inflammatory signature indicates that the autoimmune program was active at the time of weaning. Thus, the macrophages of the islets of Langerhans are poised to mount an immune response even at steady state, while the presence of the adaptive immune system elevates their activation state.},

Depletion of macrophages in C57BL/6 mice did not affect multiple parameters of islet function, including glucose response, insulin content, and transcriptional profile. In NOD mice depleted of islet-resident macrophages starting at 3 wk of age, several changes occurred: (i) the early entrance of CD4 T cells and dendritic cells into pancreatic islets was reduced, (ii) presentation of insulin epitopes by dispersed islet cells to T cells was impaired, and (iii) the development of autoimmune diabetes was significantly reduced. Treatment of NOD mice starting at 10 wk of age, when the autoimmune process has progressed, also significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes. Despite the absence of diabetes, NOD mice treated with anti–CSF-1 receptor starting at 3 or 10 wk of age still contained variably elevated leukocytic infiltrates in their islets when examined at 20–40 wk of age. Diabetes occurred in the anti–CSF-1 receptor protected mice after treatment with a blocking antibody directed against PD-1. We conclude that treatment of NOD mice with an antibody against CSF-1 receptor reduced diabetes incidence and led to the development of a regulatory pathway that controlled autoimmune progression.},

Most DCs were found next to blood vessels and resided in islets for several days. Some DCs contained insulin-like granules, and most expressed peptide–MHC complexes derived from β cell proteins. Islet DCs were highly effective in presenting β cell antigens to CD4 T cells ex vivo. Presentation of β cell-derived peptide–MHC complexes by DCs neither depended on islet inflammation nor correlated with the extent of spontaneous β cell death. Periislet stroma DCs did not contain β cell peptide–MHC complexes; however, 50\% of DCs in pancreatic node were positive. Hence, presentation of high levels of β cell antigens normally takes place by islet DCs, a finding that has to be placed in the perspective of autoimmune diabetes.},

Innate immunity is the first immunological mechanism for fighting against an intruding pathogen. It is a rapid immune response, initiated within minutes or hours after aggression, that has no immunologic memory. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, is antigen-dependent and antigen-specific; it has the capacity for memory, which enables the host to mount a more rapid and efficient immune response upon subsequent exposure to the antigen. There is a great deal of synergy between the adaptive immune system and its innate counterpart, and defects in either system can provoke illness or disease, such as inappropriate inflammation, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency disorders and hypersensitivity reactions. This article provides a practical overview of innate and adaptive immunity, and describes how these host defense mechanisms are involved in both heath and illness.},

Imaging mass cytometry revealed monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues. Moreover, in patients with COVID-19, natural killer T cells infiltrated the liver, lungs, and intestine, whereas B cells infiltrated the kidneys, lungs, and intestine. CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs also infiltrated the lungs and intestine, a phenomenon that was accompanied by overproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. However, CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs in the lungs or intestine of COVID-19 patients did not express human leukocyte antigen DR isotype. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression was higher in the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys, but not in the spleen, of all COVID-19 patients (compared to levels in controls).

	abstract = {We examine the features, origin, turnover, and gene expression of pancreatic macrophages under steady state. The data distinguish macrophages within distinct intrapancreatic microenvironments and suggest how macrophage phenotype is imprinted by the local milieu. Macrophages in islets of Langerhans and in the interacinar stroma are distinct in origin and phenotypic properties. In islets, macrophages are the only myeloid cells: they derive from definitive hematopoiesis, exchange to a minimum with blood cells, have a low level of self-replication, and depend on CSF-1. They express Il1b and Tnfa transcripts, indicating classical activation, M1, under steady state. The interacinar stroma contains two macrophage subsets. One is derived from primitive hematopoiesis, with no interchange by blood cells and alternative, M2, activation profile, whereas the second is derived from definitive hematopoiesis and exchanges with circulating myeloid cells but also shows an alternative activation profile. Complete replacement of islet and stromal macrophages by donor stem cells occurred after lethal irradiation with identical profiles as observed under steady state. The extraordinary plasticity of macrophages within the pancreatic organ and the distinct features imprinted by their anatomical localization sets the base for examining these cells in pathological conditions.},

This allows investigation into how aging affects cellular transcriptomes, and how changes in transcriptomes may underlie aging, including chronic inflammation (inflammaging), immunosenescence and cellular senescence. We compiled and tabulated aging-related single-cell datasets published to date, collected and discussed relevant findings, and inspected some of these datasets ourselves. We specifically note insights that cannot (or not easily) be based on bulk data. For example, in some datasets, the fraction of cells expressing p16 (CDKN2A), one of the most prominent markers of cellular senescence, was reported to increase, in addition to its upregulated mean expression over all cells. Moreover, we found evidence for inflammatory processes in most datasets, some of these driven by specific cells of the immune system. Further, single-cell data are specifically useful to investigate whether transcriptional heterogeneity (also called noise or variability) increases with age, and many (but not all) studies in our review report an increase in such heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate some stability of marker gene expression patterns across closely similar studies and suggest that single-cell experiments may hold the key to provide detailed insights whenever interventions (countering aging, inflammation, senescence, disease, etc.) are affecting cells depending on cell type.},

	url = {https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/24/items/1.0389926},
	abstract = {Pancreatic islet inflammation and beta-cell death are features of type 2 diabetes, contributing to inadequate insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Macrophages, innate immune cells, form a dispersed homeostatic organ found in most mammalian tissues, including insulin-producing islets. Macrophages act as local sentinel cells that can either contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu of the islet or support beta-cell proliferation in mouse models of beta-cell regeneration. They constantly monitor their surroundings and are able to uptake particles from the blood. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and -4 ligands are increased systemically in people who are newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and activation of TLRs facilitates proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Conversely, apoptotic cells promote a tissue repair program in macrophages, and apoptosis is thought to be the main mechanism of beta-cell death in type 2 diabetes. Thus, based on the hypothesis that the polarization of islet macrophages is adaptively shaped by changes in their microenvironment and has functional consequences on beta cells, this study was designed to evaluate the physiology of islet macrophages and beta cells in two settings: first, in response to TLR2/6- and TLR4- ligands, and secondly, following beta-cell death. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to thoroughly characterize islet macrophages from C57BL/6J, TLR2- and TLR4-deficient, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated, high-fat diet (HFD)-STZ-treated, and db/db mice. Macrophages were found to be major contributors to human islet IL-1β secretion in response to TLR2/6 and TLR4 ligands and reduced insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic beta cells, partly via IL-1- and IL-6-mediated decrease in insulin gene expression. Following STZ-induced beta-cell death, in diabetic db/db, and HFD+STZ mice, islet macrophages acquired a reparative state characterized by enhanced Igf1, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression. Depletion and adoptive transfer experiments indicated a role for macrophages in regulating insulin secretion in vivo, and IGF-1 neutralization during STZ-treatment decreased insulin secretion without affecting islet-cell turnover. Importantly, macrophages were still in a reparative state even when beta-cell death occurred during HFD feeding or severe hyperglycemia. Overall, these data may have implications for islet pathophysiology in type 2 diabetes and suggest that islet macrophages could be manipulated to either induce or resolve islet inflammation.},

	abstract = {Aging is a complex process that results from a combination of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. A chronic pro-inflammatory status is a pervasive feature of aging. This chronic low-grade inflammation occurring in the absence of overt infection has been defined as “inflammaging” and represents a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The low-grade inflammation persists even after reversing pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LDL cholesterol and the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Recently, several possible sources of chronic low-grade inflammation observed during aging and age-related diseases have been proposed. Cell senescence and dysregulation of innate immunity is one such mechanism by which persistent prolonged inflammation occurs even after the initial stimulus has been removed. Additionally, the coagulation factor that activates inflammatory signaling beyond its role in the coagulation system has been identified. This signal could be a new source of chronic inflammation and cell senescence. Here, we summarized the factors and cellular pathways/processes that are known to regulate low-grade persistent inflammation in aging and age-related disease.},

These studies demonstrate that cells undergoing senescence, a cellular program serving as a barrier to cancer development, produce increased amount of inflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in the initiation and maintenance of cellular senescence, and is responsible for triggering an innate immune response that clears the senescent tumor cells in vivo.

	abstract = {Background
Uncertainties persist about the magnitude of associations of diabetes mellitus and fasting glucose concentration with risk of coronary heart disease and major stroke subtypes. We aimed to quantify these associations for a wide range of circumstances.
Methods
We undertook a meta-analysis of individual records of diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentration, and other risk factors in people without initial vascular disease from studies in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration. We combined within-study regressions that were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and body-mass index to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for vascular disease.
Findings
Analyses included data for 698 782 people (52 765 non-fatal or fatal vascular outcomes; 8·49 million person-years at risk) from 102 prospective studies. Adjusted HRs with diabetes were: 2·00 (95\% CI 1·83–2·19) for coronary heart disease; 2·27 (1·95–2·65) for ischaemic stroke; 1·56 (1·19–2·05) for haemorrhagic stroke; 1·84 (1·59–2·13) for unclassified stroke; and 1·73 (1·51–1·98) for the aggregate of other vascular deaths. HRs did not change appreciably after further adjustment for lipid, inflammatory, or renal markers. HRs for coronary heart disease were higher in women than in men, at 40–59 years than at 70 years and older, and with fatal than with non-fatal disease. At an adult population-wide prevalence of 10\%, diabetes was estimated to account for 11\% (10–12\%) of vascular deaths. Fasting blood glucose concentration was non-linearly related to vascular risk, with no significant associations between 3·90 mmol/L and 5·59 mmol/L. Compared with fasting blood glucose concentrations of 3·90–5·59 mmol/L, HRs for coronary heart disease were: 1·07 (0·97–1·18) for lower than 3·90 mmol/L; 1·11 (1·04–1·18) for 5·60–6·09 mmol/L; and 1·17 (1·08–1·26) for 6·10–6·99 mmol/L. In people without a history of diabetes, information about fasting blood glucose concentration or impaired fasting glucose status did not significantly improve metrics of vascular disease prediction when added to information about several conventional risk factors.
Interpretation
Diabetes confers about a two-fold excess risk for a wide range of vascular diseases, independently from other conventional risk factors. In people without diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentration is modestly and non-linearly associated with risk of vascular disease.

	abstract = {Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Insulin, which is produced in β-cells, is a critical regulator of metabolism. Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin and processed to proinsulin. Proinsulin is then converted to insulin and C-peptide and stored in secretary granules awaiting release on demand. Insulin synthesis is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level. The cis-acting sequences within the 5′ flanking region and trans-activators including paired box gene 6 (PAX6), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1(PDX-1), MafA, and B-2/Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) regulate insulin transcription, while the stability of preproinsulin mRNA and its untranslated regions control protein translation. Insulin secretion involves a sequence of events in β-cells that lead to fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. Insulin is secreted primarily in response to glucose, while other nutrients such as free fatty acids and amino acids can augment glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, various hormones, such as melatonin, estrogen, leptin, growth hormone, and glucagon like peptide-1 also regulate insulin secretion. Thus, the β-cell is a metabolic hub in the body, connecting nutrient metabolism and the endocrine system. Although an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] is the primary insulin secretary signal, cAMP signaling-dependent mechanisms are also critical in the regulation of insulin secretion. This article reviews current knowledge on how β-cells synthesize and secrete insulin. In addition, this review presents evidence that genetic and environmental factors can lead to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and autoimmunity, resulting in β-cell dysfunction, thereby triggering the pathogenesis of diabetes.},

	abstract = {The notion that in diabetes pancreatic β-cells express endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers indicative of increased unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling is no longer in doubt. However, what remains controversial is whether this increase in ER stress response actually contributes importantly to the β-cell failure of type 2 diabetes (akin to 'terminal UPR'), or whether it represents a coping mechanism that represents the best attempt of β-cells to adapt to changes in metabolic demands as presented by disease progression. Here an intercontinental group of experts review evidence for the role of ER stress in monogenic and type 2 diabetes in an attempt to reconcile these disparate views. Current evidence implies that pancreatic β-cells require a regulated UPR for their development, function and survival, as well as to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to protein misfolding stress. Prolonged ER stress signaling, however, can be detrimental to β-cells, highlighting the importance of "optimal" UPR for ER homeostasis, β-cell function and survival.},

Proteomic technologies that use elemental (heavy metal) reporter ions, such as mass cytometry (also known as CyTOF) and analogous high-dimensional imaging approaches (including multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) and imaging mass cytometry (IMC)), have been developed from their low-dimensional counterparts, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, to meet this need. A growing number of studies have been published that use these technologies to identify functional biomarkers and therapeutic targets in rheumatic diseases, but the full potential of their application to rheumatic disease research has yet to be fulfilled. This Review introduces the underlying technologies for high-dimensional immune monitoring and discusses aspects necessary for their successful implementation, including study design principles, analytical tools and future developments for the field of rheumatology.},

Changes in glucose concentration are commonly regarded as the chief signal controlling insulin-secreting beta cells, glucagon-secreting alpha cells and somatostatin-secreting delta cells. However, each of these cell types is highly responsive to a multitude of endocrine, paracrine, nutritional and neural inputs, which collectively shape the final endocrine output of the islet. Here, we review the principal inputs for each islet-cell type and the physiological circumstances in which these signals arise, through the prism of the insights generated by the transcriptomes of each of the major endocrine-cell types.

We identified 22 CD4+ T cell clusters, including naive-like, regulatory-like and memory-like subpopulations, which were confirmed and further characterized at the transcriptional level. Memory-like CD4+ T cells had high expression of Ki-67, indicative of cell division, and CD5, a surrogate marker of TCR avidity, and produced the cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2. Pathway analysis revealed a differentiation trajectory associated with cellular activation and proinflammatory effector functions, and TCR repertoire analysis indicated clonal expansions, distinct repertoire characteristics and interconnections between subpopulations of memory-like CD4+ T cells. Imaging mass cytometry indicated that memory-like CD4+ T cells colocalized with antigen-presenting cells. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the generation of memory-like CD4+ T cells in the human fetal intestine that is consistent with exposure to foreign antigens.},

Here, we show phenotypic progression within lymphoid tissues as MZ B cells emerge from the mature naïve B cell pool via a precursor CD27−CD45RBMEM55+ population distant from memory cells. By imaging mass cytometry, we find that MZ B cells and memory B cells occupy different microanatomical niches in organised gut lymphoid tissues. Both populations disseminate widely between distant lymphoid tissues and blood, and both diversify their IGHV repertoire in gut germinal centres (GC), but nevertheless remain largely clonally separate. MZ B cells are therefore not developmentally contiguous with or analogous to classical memory B cells despite their shared ability to transit through GC, where somatic mutations are acquired.},

Immune cell trafficking into tumors is mediated by binding of specific immune cell receptors to chemokines, a class of secreted chemotactic cytokines. To broadly characterize chemokine expression and function in melanoma, we used multiplexed mass cytometry–based imaging of protein markers and RNA transcripts to analyze the chemokine landscape and immune infiltration in metastatic melanoma samples. Tumors that lacked immune infiltration were devoid of most of the profiled chemokines and exhibited low levels of antigen presentation and markers of inflammation. Infiltrated tumors were characterized by expression of multiple chemokines. CXCL9 and CXCL10 were often localized in patches associated with dysfunctional T cells expressing the B lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13. In tumors with B cells but no B cell follicles, T cells were the sole source of CXCL13, suggesting that T cells play a role in B cell recruitment and potentially in B cell follicle formation. B cell patches and follicles were also enriched with TCF7+ naïve-like T cells, a cell type that is predictive of response to immune checkpoint blockade. Our data highlight the strength of targeted RNA and protein codetection to analyze tumor immune microenvironments based on chemokine expression and suggest that the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures may be accompanied by naïve and naïve-like T cell recruitment, which may contribute to antitumor activity.},

It harbors a high mutation burden compared with other cancers and, as a result, has abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within its microenvironment. However, understanding the complex interplay between the stroma, tumor cells, and distinct TIL subsets remains a substantial challenge in immune oncology. To properly study this interplay, quantifying spatial relationships of multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment is crucial. To address this, we used cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to simultaneously quantify the expression of 35 protein markers, characterizing the microenvironment of 5 benign nevi and 67 melanomas. We profiled more than 220,000 individual cells to identify melanoma, lymphocyte subsets, macrophage/monocyte, and stromal cell populations, allowing for in-depth spatial quantification of the melanoma microenvironment. We found that within pretreatment melanomas, the abundance of proliferating antigen-experienced cytotoxic T cells (CD8+CD45RO+Ki67+) and the proximity of antigen-experienced cytotoxic T cells to melanoma cells were associated with positive response to ICIs. Our study highlights the potential of multiplexed single-cell technology to quantify spatial cell-cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment to understand immune therapy responses.},

Through analysis of {\textgreater}50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells.

Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease. Immune cells are shaped by the tissue environment, yet the states of healthy human T cells are mainly studied in the blood.

Automated cell/nuclei detection and segmentation is in general a critical step in automatic system, and is quite challenging due to the existed heterogeneous characteristics of cancer cell such as large variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the different cells. This study proposes a novel method for simultaneous detection and segmentation of cells based on the Mask R-CNN, which conducts multiple end-to-end learning tasks by minimizing multi task losses for generic object detection and segmentation. The conventional Mask R-CNN employs cross entropy loss for evaluating the object detection fidelity, and equally treats all training samples in learning procedure regardless to the properties of the objects such as easily or hard degree for detection, which may lead to miss-detection of hard samples. To boost the detection performance of hard samples, this work integrates the focal loss for formulating detection criteria into Mask R-CNN, and investigate a feasible method for balancing the contribution of multiple task losses in network training procedure. Experiments on the benchmark dataset: DSB2018 manifest that our proposed method achieves the promising performance on both cell detection and segmentation.},

It has numerous applications in medicine, particularly in cancer diagnosis. It was Albert Hewett Coons, Hugh J Creech, Norman Jones, and Ernst Berliner who conceptualized and first implemented the procedure of immunofluorescence in 1941. They used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled antibodies to localize pneumococcal antigens in infected tissues. Since then, with improvement and development of protein conjugation, enzyme labels have been introduced, such as peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The history of immunohistochemistry (IHC) combines physiology, immunology, biochemistry, and the work of various Nobel Prize laureates. From von Behring who was awarded de first Nobel Prize in 1901 for his work on serum therapy to the 1984 Nobel Prize for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies by Milstein, Kohler, and Jerne, IHC is a story of cooperation and collaboration which led to the development of this magnificent technique that is used daily in anatomical pathology laboratories worldwide.},

	abstract = {Cytometry technologies are essential tools for immunology research, providing high-throughput measurements of the immune cells at the single-cell level. Existing approaches in interpreting and using cytometry measurements include manual or automated gating to identify cell subsets from the cytometry data, providing highly intuitive results but may lead to significant information loss, in that additional details in measured or correlated cell signals might be missed. In this study, we propose and test a deep convolutional neural network for analyzing cytometry data in an end-to-end fashion, allowing a direct association between raw cytometry data and the clinical outcome of interest. Using nine large cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry or mass cytometry (CyTOF) studies from the open-access ImmPort database, we demonstrated that the deep convolutional neural network model can accurately diagnose the latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) in healthy individuals, even when using highly heterogeneous data from different studies. In addition, we developed a permutation-based method for interpreting the deep convolutional neural network model. We were able to identify a CD27- CD94+ CD8+ T cell population significantly associated with latent CMV infection, confirming the findings in previous studies. Finally, we provide a tutorial for creating, training, and interpreting the tailored deep learning model for cytometry data using Keras and TensorFlow (https://github.com/hzc363/DeepLearningCyTOF).},

It is a strong asset available for in-depth study of histology and pathophysiology of the tissues. Bearing in mind the robustness of this technique and the high spatial context of the data it gives, it is especially valuable in studying the biology of cancer and tumor microenvironment. IMC-derived data are not classical micrographic images, and due to the characteristics of the data obtained using IMC, the image analysis approach, in this case, can diverge to a certain degree from the classical image analysis pipelines. As the number of publications based on the IMC is on the rise, this trend is also followed by an increase in the number of available methodologies designated solely to IMC-derived data analysis. This review has for an aim to give a systematic synopsis of all the available classical image analysis tools and pipelines useful to be employed for IMC data analysis and give an overview of tools intentionally developed solely for this purpose, easing the choice to researchers of selecting the most suitable methodologies for a specific type of analysis desired.},

	abstract = {Traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) is inherently limited by its ability to analyze only several markers within a histological tissue section at a given time, which hinders in-depth characterization and phenotyping of tissues. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC), which combines IHC using metal-labeled antibodies with laser ablation and detection using mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), overcomes this limitation with the capability to simultaneously analyze up to 40 protein markers, to generate high-dimensional images from a single tissue section. Importantly, IMC analysis preserves tissue architecture and spatial cellular relationships, which would otherwise be lost or significantly altered in applications requiring tissue dissociation, such as flow cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing. Resulting high-dimensional histological images permit spatially conserved analysis to identify unique cell populations, cellular interactions/avoidances, and insight into activation/behavioral status based on tissue location. IMC can be performed on both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, allowing for previously banked samples to be analyzed and correlated with known clinical outcomes. Expectedly, IMC will change the landscape of investigative pathology, particularly when used in coordination with multiomic platforms to combine transcriptomic and proteomic data at a single-cell resolution. Here, we aim to highlight the potential utility of IMC within dermatologic research and clinical applications.},

Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer’s disease.},

An advanced understanding of cardiovascular disease mechanisms is required to improve therapeutic strategies and patient risk stratification. State-of-the-art, large-scale, single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics facilitate the exploration of the cardiac cellular landscape at an unprecedented level, beyond its descriptive features, and can further our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and guide functional studies. In this Review, we provide an overview of the technical challenges in the experimental design of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics studies, as well as a discussion of the type of inferences that can be made from the data derived from these studies. Furthermore, we describe novel findings derived from transcriptomics studies for each major cardiac cell type in both health and disease, and from development to adulthood. This Review also provides a guide to interpreting the exhaustive list of newly identified cardiac cell types and states, and highlights the consensus and discordances in annotation, indicating an urgent need for standardization. We describe advanced applications such as integration of single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics to map genes and cells on tissue and define cellular microenvironments that regulate homeostasis and disease progression. Finally, we discuss current and future translational and clinical implications of novel transcriptomics approaches, and provide an outlook of how these technologies will change the way we diagnose and treat heart disease.},

A myriad of studies have highlighted their central role in immune function4–13, yet we lack a global view of the cellular responses of each immune cell type to each cytokine. To address this gap, we created the Immune Dictionary, a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic profiles of more than 17 immune cell types in response to each of 86 cytokines ({\textgreater}1,400 cytokine–cell type combinations) in mouse lymph nodes in vivo. A cytokine-centric view of the dictionary revealed that most cytokines induce highly cell-type-specific responses. For example, the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β induces distinct gene programmes in almost every cell type. A cell-type-centric view of the dictionary identified more than 66 cytokine-driven cellular polarization states across immune cell types, including previously uncharacterized states such as an interleukin-18-induced polyfunctional natural killer cell state. Based on this dictionary, we developed companion software, Immune Response Enrichment Analysis, for assessing cytokine activities and immune cell polarization from gene expression data, and applied it to reveal cytokine networks in tumours following immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our dictionary generates new hypotheses for cytokine functions, illuminates pleiotropic effects of cytokines, expands our knowledge of activation states of each immune cell type, and provides a framework to deduce the roles of specific cytokines and cell–cell communication networks in any immune response.},

Recent advances in single-cell genomics are altering our understanding of the Waddington landscape, yet the molecular mechanisms of cell-fate decisions remain poorly understood. We constructed a cell landscape of mouse lineage differentiation during development at the single-cell level and described both lineage-common and lineage-specific regulatory programs during cell-type maturation. We also found lineage-common regulatory programs that are broadly active during the development of invertebrates and vertebrates. In particular, we identified Xbp1 as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cell-fate determinations across different species. We demonstrated that Xbp1 transcriptional regulation is important for the stabilization of the gene-regulatory networks for a wide range of mouse cell types. Our results offer genetic and molecular insights into cellular gene-regulatory programs and will serve as a basis for further advancing the understanding of cell-fate decisions.},

Despite extensive efforts to characterize the cellular heterogeneity of different organisms, cross-species comparisons of landscape dynamics have not been achieved. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map organism-level cell landscapes at multiple life stages for mice, zebrafish and Drosophila. By integrating the comprehensive dataset of \&gt; 2.6 million single cells, we constructed a cross-species cell landscape and identified signatures and common pathways that changed throughout the life span. We identified structural inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction as the most common hallmarks of organism aging, and found that pharmacological activation of mitochondrial metabolism alleviated aging phenotypes in mice. The cross-species cell landscape with other published datasets were stored in an integrated online portal—Cell Landscape. Our work provides a valuable resource for studying lineage development, maturation and aging.How many cell types are there in nature? How do they change during the life cycle? These are two fundamental questions that researchers have been trying to understand in the area of biology. In this study, single-cell mRNA sequencing data were used to profile over 2.6 million individual cells from mice, zebrafish and Drosophila at different life stages, 1.3 million of which were newly collected. The comprehensive datasets allow investigators to construct a cross-species cell landscape that helps to reveal the conservation and diversity of cell taxonomies at genetic and regulatory levels.

Here we present a compendium of cell types across multiple organs in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using both single-cell chromatin accessibility and RNA sequencing data. The integrated cell map enables in-depth dissection and comparison of molecular dynamics, cell-type compositions and cellular heterogeneity across multiple tissues and organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we infer pseudotime cell trajectories and cell-cell communications to uncover key molecular signatures underlying their cellular processes. Furthermore, we identify various cell-specific cis-regulatory elements and construct organ-specific gene regulatory networks at the single-cell level. Finally, we perform comparative analyses of single-cell landscapes among mouse, monkey and human. We show that cynomolgus monkey has strikingly higher degree of similarities in terms of immune-associated gene expression patterns and cellular communications to human than mouse.

RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology—the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Recently, significant attention has focused on investigating, from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, cellular dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell (de)activation. Trajectory inference methods estimate a trajectory, a collection of differentiation paths of a dynamic system, by ordering cells along the paths of such a dynamic process. While trajectory inference tools typically work with gene expression levels, common scRNA-seq protocols allow the identification and quantification of unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature spliced mRNAs, for each gene. By exploiting the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA, one can infer the RNA velocity of individual cells, i.e., the time derivative of the gene expression state of cells. Whereas traditional trajectory inference methods reconstruct cellular dynamics given a population of cells of varying maturity, RNA velocity relies on a dynamical model describing splicing dynamics. Here, we initially discuss conceptual and theoretical aspects of both approaches, then illustrate how they can be combined together, and finally present an example use-case on real data.

Conventional RNA velocity models infer universal kinetics from all cells in an scRNA-seq experiment, resulting in unpredictable performance in experiments with multi-stage and/or multi-lineage transition of cell states where the assumption of the same kinetic rates for all cells no longer holds. Here we present cellDancer, a scalable deep neural network that locally infers velocity for each cell from its neighbors and then relays a series of local velocities to provide single-cell resolution inference of velocity kinetics. In the simulation benchmark, cellDancer shows robust performance in multiple kinetic regimes, high dropout ratio datasets and sparse datasets. We show that cellDancer overcomes the limitations of existing RNA velocity models in modeling erythroid maturation and hippocampus development. Moreover, cellDancer provides cell-specific predictions of transcription, splicing and degradation rates, which we identify as potential indicators of cell fate in the mouse pancreas.},

Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin data over a dense time course in human organoids covering neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization and neurogenesis, and identify temporally dynamic and brain-region-specific regulatory regions. We developed Pando—a flexible framework that incorporates multi-omic data and predictions of transcription-factor-binding sites to infer a global gene regulatory network describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoids. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors affect neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the transcription factor GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous research performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify two distinct GLI3 regulomes that are central to telencephalic fate decisions: one regulating dorsoventral patterning with HES4/5 as direct GLI3 targets, and one controlling ganglionic eminence diversification later in development. Together, we provide a framework for how human model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human developmental biology.},

Through systematic in silico transcription factor perturbation in the developing zebrafish, we simulate and experimentally validate a previously unreported phenotype that results from the loss of noto, an established notochord regulator. Furthermore, we identify an axial mesoderm regulator, lhx1a.

	abstract = {The selection of carbohydrates or fat to generate intracellular energy is thought to be crucial for long-term metabolic health. While most studies assess fuel selection after a metabolic challenge, the determinants of substrate oxidation in the fasted state remain largely unexplored. We therefore assessed the respiratory quotient by indirect calorimetry as a read-out for substrate oxidation following an overnight fast. This cross-sectional analysis consisted of 192 (92 women, 100 men) either lean or obese participants. Following an overnight fast, the respiratory quotient (RQ) was assessed, after which a 5-point 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Unlike glucose and insulin, fasting free fatty acids (FFA) correlated negatively with fasting RQ (p {\textless} 0.0001). Participants with high levels of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyric acid had significantly lower RQ values. Fasting levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glicentin were positively associated with fasting RQ (all p ≤ 0.03), whereas GLP-1 showed no significant association. Neither BMI, nor total body fat, nor body fat distribution correlated with fasting RQ. No relationship between the RQ and diabetes or the metabolic syndrome could be observed. In the fasting state, FFA concentrations were strongly linked to the preferentially oxidized substrate. Our data did not indicate any relationship between fasting substrate oxidation and metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Since glicentin and GIP are linked to fuel selection in the fasting state, novel therapeutic approaches that target these hormones may have the potential to modulate substrate oxidation.},

In this Beyond the Cell review, we focus on these five stages of the journey of insulin through the body and the captivating cell biology that underlies the interaction of insulin with each organ. We first analyze insulin’s biosynthesis in and export from the β-cells of the pancreas. Next, we focus on its first pass and partial clearance in the liver with its temporality and periodicity linked to secretion. Continuing the journey, we briefly describe insulin’s action on the blood vasculature and its still-debated mechanisms of exit from the capillary beds. Once in the parenchymal interstitium of muscle and adipose tissue, insulin promotes glucose uptake into myofibers and adipocytes, and we elaborate on the intricate signaling and vesicle traffic mechanisms that underlie this fundamental function. Finally, we touch upon the renal degradation of insulin to end its action. Cellular discernment of insulin’s availability and action should prove critical to understanding its pivotal physiological functions and how their failure leads to diabetes.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the prominent causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and beyond, reaching global pandemic proportions. One hallmark of T2D is dysfunctional glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cell. Insulin is secreted via the recruitment of insulin secretory granules to the plasma membrane, where the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and SNARE regulators work together to dock the secretory granules and release insulin into the circulation. SNARE proteins and their regulators include the Syntaxins, SNAPs, Sec1/Munc18, VAMPs, and double C2-domain proteins. Recent studies using genomics, proteomics, and biochemical approaches have linked deficiencies of exocytosis proteins with the onset and progression of T2D. Promising results are also emerging wherein restoration or enhancement of certain exocytosis proteins to β-cells improves whole-body glucose homeostasis, enhances β-cell function, and surprisingly, protection of β-cell mass. Intriguingly, overexpression and knockout studies have revealed novel functions of certain exocytosis proteins, like Syntaxin 4, suggesting that exocytosis proteins can impact a variety of pathways, including inflammatory signaling and aging. In this review, we present the conventional and unconventional functions of β-cell exocytosis proteins in normal physiology and T2D and describe how these insights might improve clinical care for T2D.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes has been coined “a two-hit disease,” as it involves specific defects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells in addition to defects in peripheral tissue insulin action required for glucose uptake. Both of these processes, insulin secretion and glucose uptake, are mediated by SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein core complexes composed of syntaxin, SNAP-23/25, and VAMP proteins. The SNARE core complex is regulated by the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family of proteins, which selectively bind to their cognate syntaxin isoforms with high affinity. The process of insulin secretion uses multiple Munc18-syntaxin isoform pairs, whereas insulin action in the peripheral tissues appears to use only the Munc18c-syntaxin 4 pair. Importantly, recent reports have linked obesity and Type 2 diabetes in humans with changes in protein levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Munc18 and syntaxin isoforms relevant to these exocytotic processes, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes remain incomplete (, , ). Given the conservation of these proteins in two seemingly disparate processes and the need to design and implement novel and more effective clinical interventions, it will be vitally important to delineate the mechanisms governing these conserved SNARE-mediated exocytosis events. Thus, we provide here an up-to-date historical review of advancements in defining the roles and molecular mechanisms of Munc18-syntaxin complexes in the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {It is hypothesized that glucokinase (GCK) is the glucose sensor not only for regulation of insulin release by pancreatic β-cells, but also for the rest of the cells that contribute to glucose homeostasis in mammals. This includes other cells in endocrine pancreas (α- and δ-cells), adrenal gland, glucose sensitive neurons, entero-endocrine cells, and cells in the anterior pituitary. Glucose transport is by facilitated diffusion and is not rate limiting. Once inside, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by GCK in a reaction that is dependent on glucose throughout the physiological range of concentrations, is irreversible, and not product inhibited. High glycerol phosphate shuttle, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate carboxylase activities, combined with low pentose-P shunt, lactate dehydrogenase, plasma membrane monocarboxylate transport, and glycogen synthase activities constrain glucose-6-phosphate to being metabolized through glycolysis. Under these conditions, glycolysis produces mostly pyruvate and little lactate. Pyruvate either enters the citric acid cycle through pyruvate dehydrogenase or is carboxylated by pyruvate carboxylase. Reducing equivalents from glycolysis enter oxidative phosphorylation through both the glycerol phosphate shuttle and citric acid cycle. Raising glucose concentration increases intramitochondrial [NADH]/[NAD+] and thereby the energy state ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]), decreasing [Mg2+ADP] and [AMP]. [Mg2+ADP] acts through control of KATP channel conductance, whereas [AMP] acts through regulation of AMP-dependent protein kinase. Specific roles of different cell types are determined by the diverse molecular mechanisms used to couple energy state to cell specific responses. Having a common glucose sensor couples complementary regulatory mechanisms into a tightly regulated and stable glucose homeostatic network.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic beta cells (β-cells) differentiate during fetal life, but only postnatally acquire the capacity for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). How this happens is not clear. In exploring what molecular mechanisms drive the maturation of β-cell function, we found that the control of cellular signaling in β-cells fundamentally switched from the nutrient sensor target of rapamycin (mTORC1) to the energy sensor 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and that this was critical for functional maturation. Moreover, AMPK was activated by the dietary transition taking place during weaning, and this in turn inhibited mTORC1 activity to drive the adult β-cell phenotype. While forcing constitutive mTORC1 signaling in adult β-cells relegated them to a functionally immature phenotype with characteristic transcriptional and metabolic profiles, engineering the switch from mTORC1 to AMPK signaling was sufficient to promote β-cell mitochondrial biogenesis, a shift to oxidative metabolism, and functional maturation. We also found that type 2 diabetes, a condition marked by both mitochondrial degeneration and dysregulated GSIS, was associated with a remarkable reversion of the normal AMPK-dependent adult β-cell signature to a more neonatal one characterized by mTORC1 activation. Manipulating the way in which cellular nutrient signaling pathways regulate β-cell metabolism may thus offer new targets to improve β-cell function in diabetes.},

	abstract = {The ability to maintain normoglycaemia, through glucose-sensitive insulin release, is a key aspect of postnatal beta cell function. However, terminally differentiated beta cell identity does not necessarily imply functional maturity. Beta cell maturation is therefore a continuation of beta cell development, albeit a process that occurs postnatally in mammals. Although many important features have been identified in the study of beta cell maturation, as of yet no unified mechanistic model of beta cell functional maturity exists. Here, we review recent findings about the underlying mechanisms of beta cell functional maturation. These findings include systemic hormonal and nutritional triggers that operate through energy-sensing machinery shifts within beta cells, resulting in primed metabolic states that allow for appropriate glucose trafficking and, ultimately, insulin release. We also draw attention to the expansive synergistic nature of these pathways and emphasise that beta cell maturation is dependent on overlapping regulatory and metabolic networks.},

The commercial launch of the first massively parallel pyrosequencing platform in 2005 ushered in the new era of high-throughput genomic analysis now referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS).Content: This review describes fundamental principles of commercially available NGS platforms. Although the platforms differ in their engineering configurations and sequencing chemistries, they share a technical paradigm in that sequencing of spatially separated, clonally amplified DNA templates or single DNA molecules is performed in a flow cell in a massively parallel manner. Through iterative cycles of polymerase-mediated nucleotide extensions or, in one approach, through successive oligonucleotide ligations, sequence outputs in the range of hundreds of megabases to gigabases are now obtained routinely. Highlighted in this review are the impact of NGS on basic research, bioinformatics considerations, and translation of this technology into clinical diagnostics. Also presented is a view into future technologies, including real-time single-molecule DNA sequencing and nanopore-based sequencing.Summary: In the relatively short time frame since 2005, NGS has fundamentally altered genomics research and allowed investigators to conduct experiments that were previously not technically feasible or affordable. The various technologies that constitute this new paradigm continue to evolve, and further improvements in technology robustness and process streamlining will pave the path for translation into clinical diagnostics.},

Expression levels of specific genes, differential splicing, allele-specific expression of transcripts can be accurately determined by RNA-Seq experiments to address many biological-related issues. All these attributes are not readily achievable from previously widespread hybridization-based or tag sequence-based approaches. However, the unprecedented level of sensitivity and the large amount of available data produced by NGS platforms provide clear advantages as well as new challenges and issues. This technology brings the great power to make several new biological observations and discoveries, it also requires a considerable effort in the development of new bioinformatics tools to deal with these massive data files.

Because cellular processes are governed by the repertoire of expressed genes, and the levels and timing of expression, it is important to have experimental tools for the direct monitoring of large numbers of mRNAs in parallel. We have developed an approach that is based on hybridization to small, high-density arrays containing tens of thousands of synthetic oligonucleotides. The arrays are designed based on sequence information alone and are synthesized in situ using a combination of photolithography and oligonucleotide chemistry. RNAs present at a frequency of 1:300,000 are unambiguously detected, and detection is quantitative over more than three orders of magnitude. This approach provides a way to use directly the growing body of sequence information for highly parallel experimental investigations. Because of the combinatorial nature of the chemistry and the ability to synthesize small arrays containing hundreds of thousands of specifically chosen oligonucleotides, the method is readily scalable to the simultaneous monitoring of tens of thousands of genes.},

Identifying regulators of this process is paramount to combatting multiple pancreatic diseases. Here we show that pancreatic deletion of the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) leads to hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and hypolipidemia. Surprisingly, insulin and digestive enzymes are produced in the absence of NFIA, however, they are not secreted properly and instead accumulate inside pancreatic cells. In NFIA-deficient mice we saw a reduction of insulin granules in the ready releasable pool and the first-phase insulin response was impaired. We found that NFIA binds to and activates Rab39b, a Rab GTPase critical for exocytosis. Re-expression of Rab39b in NFIA knockout islets restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In sum, the NFIA-Rab39b axis regulates pancreatic physiology through granule recruitment and docking, linking NFIA to a new process with potential effects in diabetes, pancreatitis, and lipid disorders.},

Pancreatic deletion of NFIA leads to cell fate defects, with increased duct and decreased endocrine formation, while ectopic expression promotes endocrine formation in mice and human pancreatic progenitors. NFIA-deﬁcient mice exhibit dysregulation of trafﬁcking-related genes including increased expression of Mib1, which acts to target Dll1 for endocytosis.

	abstract = {Background
Glucose homeostasis is dependent on functional pancreatic α and ß cells. The mechanisms underlying the generation and maturation of these endocrine cells remain unclear.

Results
We unravel the molecular mode of action of ISL1 in controlling α cell fate and the formation of functional ß cells in the pancreas. By combining transgenic mouse models, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling, we uncover that elimination of Isl1 results in a diabetic phenotype with a complete loss of α cells, disrupted pancreatic islet architecture, downregulation of key ß-cell regulators and maturation markers of ß cells, and an enrichment in an intermediate endocrine progenitor transcriptomic profile.

Conclusions
Mechanistically, apart from the altered transcriptome of pancreatic endocrine cells, Isl1 elimination results in altered silencing H3K27me3 histone modifications in the promoter regions of genes that are essential for endocrine cell differentiation. Our results thus show that ISL1 transcriptionally and epigenetically controls α cell fate competence, and ß cell maturation, suggesting that ISL1 is a critical component for generating functional α and ß cells.

A further objective was to identify endocrine cell biomarkers, targets of diabetic autoimmunity, and regulatory pathways underlying islet responses to physiological and pathological stimuli., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—mRNA expression profiling was performed by microarray analysis of e12.5–18.5 embryonic pancreas from neurogenin 3 (Ngn3)-null mice, a background that abrogates endocrine pancreatic differentiation. The intersection of this data with mRNA expression in isolated adult pancreatic islets and pancreatic endocrine tumor cell lines was determined to compile lists of genes that are specifically expressed in endocrine cells., RESULTS—The data provided insight into the transcriptional and morphogenetic factors that may play major roles in patterning and differentiation of the endocrine lineage before and during the secondary transition of endocrine development, as well as genes that control the glucose responsiveness of the β-cells and candidate diabetes autoantigens, such as insulin, IA-2 and Slc30a8 (ZnT8). The results are presented as downloadable gene lists, available at https://www.cbil.upenn.edu/RADQuerier/php/displayStudy.php?study\_id=1330, stratified by predictive scores of relative cell-type specificity., CONCLUSIONS—The deposited data provide a rich resource that can be used to address diverse questions related to islet developmental and cell biology and the pathogenesis of type 1 and 2 diabetes.},

In parallel, advances in deep learning allow rapid analysis of newly generated query datasets by mapping them into reference atlases. However, existing data transformations learned to map query data are not easily explainable using biologically known concepts such as genes or pathways. Here we propose expiMap, a biologically informed deep-learning architecture that enables single-cell reference mapping. ExpiMap learns to map cells into biologically understandable components representing known ‘gene programs’. The activity of each cell for a gene program is learned while simultaneously refining them and learning de novo programs. We show that expiMap compares favourably to existing methods while bringing an additional layer of interpretability to integrative single-cell analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to analyse single-cell perturbation responses in different tissues and species and resolve responses of patients who have coronavirus disease 2019 to different treatments across cell types.},

To study the changes in gene expression by pancreatic β cells under insulin resistance conditions.
Method
An exhaustive gene expression analysis was performed, using isolated pancreatic islets of obese diabetic model Lepr−/− mice. Overexpression of cyclin D2 was induced in cells from the pancreatic β cell line, namely, INS-1.
Results
Through a gene expression analysis using islets isolated from db/db mice, we found a significant increase in the expression of ribosome-related molecules. In addition, increased expression of cyclin D2 was found at certain protein levels. As INS-1 cells were induced to overexpress cyclin D2, we found an increase in the expression of ribosome-related molecules. Concurrently, an increase in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)-related molecules was also found.
Conclusion
In cases of pancreatic β cell hyperplasia associated with insulin resistance, ribosomal biogenesis is increased, and ER stress is induced.},

Few studies have interrogated the molecular mechanisms of β-cell dysfunction at the level of mRNA translation under such conditions. We sought to address this issue through polyribosome profile analysis of islets from mice fed 16-weeks of 42\% HFD. HFD-islet analysis revealed clear trends toward global reductions in mRNA translation with a significant reduction in the polyribosome/monoribosome ratio for Pdx1 mRNA. Transcriptional and translational analyses revealed endoplasmic reticulum stress was not the etiology of our findings. HFD-islets demonstrated evidence of oxidative stress and DNA damage, as well as activation of p53. Experiments in MIN-6 β-cells revealed that treatment with doxorubicin to directly induce DNA damage mimicked our observed effects in islets. Islets from animals treated with pioglitazone concurrently with HFD demonstrated a reversal of effects observed from HFD alone. Finally, HFD-islets demonstrated reduced expression of multiple ribosome biogenesis genes and the key translation initiation factor eIF4E. We propose a heretofore unappreciated effect of chronic HFD on β-cells, wherein continued DNA damage owing to persistent oxidative stress results in p53 activation and a resultant inhibition of mRNA translation.},

Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and metabolic parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico-metabolic parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58.5 nmol/L, p = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty acids, and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for insulin levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, serum SCG3 concentrations were higher in subjects with MetS and were independently associated with FPG levels.},

	abstract = {Autocrine insulin signaling is critical for pancreatic β-cell growth and activity and is at least partially controlled by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that act on insulin receptors (IRs). The receptor-type PTP phogrin primarily localizes on insulin secretory granules in pancreatic β cells. We recently reported that phogrin knockdown decreases the protein levels of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), whereas high-glucose stimulation promotes formation of a phogrin–IR complex that stabilizes IRS2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which phogrin affects IRS2 levels are unclear. Here, we found that relative to wildtype mice, IRS2 levels in phogrin-knockout mice islets decreased by 44\%. When phogrin was silenced by shRNA in pancreatic β-cell lines, glucose-induced insulin signaling led to proteasomal degradation of IRS2 via a negative feedback mechanism. Phogrin overexpression in a murine hepatocyte cell line consistently prevented chronic insulin treatment–induced IRS2 degradation. In vitro, phogrin directly bound the IR without the assistance of other proteins and protected recombinant PTP1B from oxidation to potentiate its activity toward the IR. Furthermore, phogrin expression suppressed insulin-induced local generation of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent PTP1B oxidation, which allowed progression of IR dephosphorylation. Together, these results suggest that a transient interaction of phogrin with the IR enables glucose-stimulated autocrine insulin signaling through the regulation of PTP1B activity, which is essential for suppressing feedback-mediated IRS2 degradation in pancreatic β cells.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dedifferentiation of pancreatic β-cells may reduce islet function in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the prevalence, plasticity and functional consequences of this cellular state remain unknown.
METHODS: We employed single-cell RNAseq to detail the maturation program of α- and β-cells during human ontogeny. We also compared islets from non-diabetic and T2D individuals.
RESULTS: Both α- and β-cells mature in part by repressing non-endocrine genes; however, α-cells retain hallmarks of an immature state, while β-cells attain a full β-cell specific gene expression program. In islets from T2D donors, both α- and β-cells have a less mature expression profile, de-repressing the juvenile genetic program and exocrine genes and increasing expression of exocytosis, inflammation and stress response signalling pathways. These changes are consistent with the increased proportion of β-cells displaying suboptimal function observed in T2D islets.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the molecular program underlying islet cell maturation during human ontogeny and the loss of transcriptomic maturity that occurs in islets of type 2 diabetics.},

	abstract = {The molecular underpinnings of β-cell dysfunction and death leading to diabetes are not fully elucidated. The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) in pancreatic β-cells. Chemically induced ERAD deficiency in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 markedly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The mechanistic basis for this effect was studied in cells and mice lacking ERAD as a consequence of genetic ablation of the core ERAD protein SEL1L. Targeted disruption of SEL1L in INS-1 cells and in mouse pancreatic β-cells impaired ERAD and led to blunted GSIS. Additionally, mice with SEL1L deletion in β-cells were chronically hyperglycemic after birth and increasingly glucose intolerant over time. SEL1L absence caused an entrapment of proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment in both INS-1 cells and mouse pancreatic β-cells. Both folding-competent and folding-deficient proinsulin can physiologically interact with and be efficiently degraded by HRD1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the ERAD complex. GSIS impairment in insulinoma cells was accompanied by a reduced intracellular Ca2+ ion level, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and lowered mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings suggest that ERAD plays a pivotal role in supporting pancreatic β-cell function by targeting wild-type and folding-deficient proinsulin for proteosomal degradation. ERAD deficiency may contribute to the development of diabetes by affecting proinsulin processing in the ER, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and mitochondrial function.},

Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell–cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq.

With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.

	abstract = {Consumption of foods high in saturated fatty acids (FAs) as well as elevated levels of circulating free FAs are known to be associated with T2D. Though previous studies showed inflammation is crucially involved in the development of insulin resistance, how inflammation contributes to β cell dysfunction has remained unclear. We report here the saturated FA palmitate induces β cell dysfunction in vivo by activating inflammatory processes within islets. Through a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies, we show β cells respond to palmitate via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway and produce chemokines that recruit CD11b(+)Ly-6C(+) M1-type proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the islets. Depletion of M1-type cells protected mice from palmitate-induced β cell dysfunction. Islet inflammation also plays an essential role in β cell dysfunction in T2D mouse models. Collectively, these results demonstrate a clear mechanistic link between β cell dysfunction and inflammation mediated at least in part via the FFA-TLR4/MyD88 pathway.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, in which GBM stem cells (GSCs) were identified to contribute to aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Yet, how GSCs progress to invasive cells remains largely unexplored. Here, we revealed the cell subpopulations with distinct functional status and the existence of cells with high invasive potential within heterogeneous primary GBM tumors. We reconstructed a branched trajectory by pseudotemporal ordering of single tumor cells, in which the root showed GSC-like phenotype while the end displayed high invasive activity. Thus, we further determined a path along which GSCs gradually transformed to invasive cells, called the ‘stem-to-invasion path’. Along this path, cells showed incremental expression of GBM invasion-associated signatures and diminishing expression of GBM stem cell markers. These findings were validated in an independent single-cell data set of GBM. Through analyzing the molecular cascades underlying the path, we identify crucial factors controlling the attainment of invasive potential of tumor cells, including transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs. Our work provides novel insights into GBM progression, especially the attainment of invasive potential in primary tumor cells, and supports the cancer stem cell model, with valuable implications for GBM therapy.},

	abstract = {Periodontal health is dependent on a symbiotic relationship of the host immune response with the oral microbiota. Pathologic shifts of the microbial plaque elicit an immune response that eventually leads to the recruitment and activation of osteoclasts and matrix metalloproteinases and the eventual tissue destruction that is evident in periodontal disease. Once the microbial stimulus is removed, an active process of inflammatory resolution begins. The goal of this work was to use scRNAseq to demonstrate the unique cellular immune response across three distinct conditions of periodontal health, disease, and resolution using mouse models. Periodontal disease was induced using a ligature model. Resolution was modeled by removing the ligature and allowing the mouse to recover. Immune cells (Cd45+) were isolated from the periodontium and analyzed via scRNAseq. Gene signature shifts across the three conditions were characterized and shown to be largely driven by macrophage and neutrophils during the periodontal disease and resolution conditions. Resolution of periodontal disease was characterized by the differential regulation of unique gene subsets. Clustering analysis characterized multiple cellular subpopulations within B Cells, macrophages, and neutrophils that demonstrated differential expansion and contraction across conditions of periodontal health, disease, and resolution. Interestingly, we identified a transcriptionally distinct macrophage subpopulation that expanded during the resolution condition and demonstrated an immunoregulatory gene signature. We identified a cell surface marker for this resolution-associated macrophage subgroup (Cd74) and validated the expansion of this subgroup during resolution via flow cytometry. This work presents a robust immune cell atlas for study of the immunological changes in the oral mucosa during three distinct conditions of periodontal health, disease, and resolution and it improves our understanding of the cellular and molecular markers that characterize health from disease for the development of future diagnostics and therapies.},

We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics at multiple developmental time points and revealed distinct temporal-spatial gene cascades. Cell trajectory inference identiﬁed endocrine progenitor populations and branch-speciﬁc genes as the progenitors differentiate toward alpha or beta cells. Spatial differentiation trajectories indicated that Schwann cells are spatially co-located with endocrine progenitors, and cell-cell connectivity analysis predicted that they may interact via L1CAMEPHB2 signaling. Our integrated approach enabled us to identify heterogeneity and multiple lineage dynamics within the mesenchyme, showing that it contributed to the exocrine acinar cell state.

In adipose, tissue-resident and recruited T and B cells have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance during diet-induced obesity and ageing, but whether this is paralleled in the pancreatic islets is not known.

Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of β-cells from 3- and 26-month-old mice to explore how changes in gene expression contribute to improved function with age. The old mice were healthy and had reduced blood glucose levels and increased β-cell mass, which correlated to their body weight. β-Cells from young and old mice had similar transcriptome profiles. In fact, only 193 genes (0.89\% of all detected genes) were significantly regulated (≥2-fold; false discovery rate \&lt; 0.01; normalized counts \&gt; 5). Of these, 183 were down-regulated and mainly associated with pathways regulating gene expression, cell cycle, cell death, and survival as well as cellular movement, function, and maintenance.

Here, we report that Sox9, a transcriptional regulator of pancreas development, also functions in mature beta cells. Our results show that Sox9-depleted rodent beta cells have defective insulin secretion, and aging animals develop glucose intolerance, mimicking the progressive degeneration observed in T2D. Using genome editing in human stem cells, we show that beta cells lacking SOX9 have stunted first-phase insulin secretion. In human and rodent cells, loss of Sox9 disrupts alternative splicing and triggers accumulation of non-functional isoforms of genes with key roles in beta cell function. Sox9 depletion reduces expression of protein-coding splice variants of the serine-rich splicing factor arginine SRSF5, a major splicing enhancer that regulates alternative splicing. Our data highlight the role of SOX9 as a regulator of alternative splicing in mature beta cell function.},

In contrast, beta cells release insulin in response to elevated glucose to stimulate peripheral glucose disposal. Despite these opposing roles in glucose homeostasis, alpha and beta cells derive from a common progenitor and share many proteins important for glucose sensing and hormone secretion. Recent work has underlined these similarities between the two cell types by showing that beta-to-alpha as well as alpha-to-beta transdifferentiation can take place under certain experimental circumstances. These exciting findings highlight unexpected plasticity in adult islets and offer hope of novel therapeutic paths to replenish beta cells in diabetes. In this review we focus on the transcription factor networks that establish and maintain pancreatic endocrine cell identity and how they may be perturbed to facilitate transdifferentiation.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels and has become the third leading threat to human health after cancer and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown that autophagy is closely associated with diabetes. Under normal physiological conditions, autophagy promotes cellular homeostasis, reduces damage to healthy tissues and has bidirectional effects on regulating diabetes. However, under pathological conditions, unregulated autophagy activation leads to cell death and may contribute to the progression of diabetes. Therefore, restoring normal autophagy may be a key strategy to treat diabetes. High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a chromatin protein that is mainly present in the nucleus and can be actively secreted or passively released from necrotic, apoptotic, and inflammatory cells. HMGB1 can induce autophagy by activating various pathways. Studies have shown that HMGB1 plays an important role in insulin resistance and diabetes. In this review, we will introduce the biological and structural characteristics of HMGB1 and summarize the existing knowledge on the relationship between HMGB1, autophagy, diabetes, and diabetic complications. We will also summarize potential therapeutic strategies that may be useful for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications.},

Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is a member of the ATF/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family whose levels are increased upon stress in pancreatic islets from mice. Intriguingly, ATF5 deficiency has been shown to contribute to increased ER stress and apoptosis in mouse islet micro-organs. We hypothesized that either deficiency or overexpression of ATF5 is equally deleterious for pancreatic islets in terms of ER stress and apoptosis. To test this, we used a number of in vitro and in vivo models whereby ATF5 levels were overexpressed. We also determined the regulation of ATF5 in the context of metabolic derangements by using various mouse models of obesity and T2D. Our in vitro results show that ATF5 overexpression promoted palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxic apoptosis. In vivo, global ATF5 overexpression in mice was lethal and pancreas-specific ATF5 overexpressing mice exhibit increased β-cell apoptosis. Interestingly, ATF5 is downregulated in all mouse models of severe obesity and T2D used in the current study. In conclusion, a tight control on ATF5 levels might be considered when developing novel agents targeting ATF5 for prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

	abstract = {Background: The commercially available 10x Genomics protocol to generate droplet-based single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is enjoying growing popularity among researchers. Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method to use. Methods: Here we use one gold standard 10x Genomics dataset, generated from the mixture of three cell lines, as well as multiple silver standard 10x Genomics datasets generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine not only the accuracy but also running time and robustness of a dozen methods. Results: We found that Seurat outperformed other methods, although performance seems to be dependent on many factors, including the complexity of the studied system. Furthermore, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other. Conclusions: In light of this we conclude that the choice of clustering tool crucially determines interpretation of scRNA-seq data generated by 10x Genomics. Hence practitioners and consumers should remain vigilant about the outcome of 10x Genomics scRNA-seq analysis.},

This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 14 clustering algorithms implemented in R, including both methods developed explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using nine publicly available scRNA-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves.,  We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time and scalability of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering.,  All the code used for the evaluation is available on GitHub (
https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/scRNAseq\_clustering\_comparison). In addition, an R package providing access to data and clustering results, thereby facilitating inclusion of new methods and data sets, is available from Bioconductor (

We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

	abstract = {Almost all biomedical research to date has relied upon mean measurements from cell populations, however it is well established that what it is observed at this macroscopic level can be the result of many interactions of several different single cells. Thus, the observable macroscopic ‘average’ cannot outright be used as representative of the ‘average cell’. Rather, it is the resulting emerging behaviour of the actions and interactions of many different cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) enables the comparison of the transcriptomes of individual cells. This provides high-resolution maps of the dynamic cellular programmes allowing us to answer fundamental biological questions on their function and evolution. It also allows to address medical questions such as the role of rare cell populations contributing to disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, it provides an understanding of context-specific dependencies, namely the behaviour and function that a cell has in a specific context, which can be crucial to understand some complex diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Here, we provide an overview of scRNA-Seq, including a comparative review of emerging technologies and computational pipelines. We discuss the current and emerging applications and focus on tumour heterogeneity a clear example of how scRNA-Seq can provide new understanding of a complex disease. Additionally, we review the limitations and highlight the need of powerful computational pipelines and reproducible protocols for the broader acceptance of this technique in basic and clinical research.},

However, these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies generate an extraordinary amount of data, which creates analysis and interpretation challenges. Additionally, scRNA-seq datasets often contain technical sources of noise owing to incomplete RNA capture, PCR amplification biases and/or batch effects specific to the patient or sample. If not addressed, this technical noise can bias the analysis and interpretation of the data. In response to these challenges, a suite of computational tools has been developed to process, analyse and visualize scRNA-seq datasets. Although the specific steps of any given scRNA-seq analysis might differ depending on the biological questions being asked, a core workflow is used in most analyses. Typically, raw sequencing reads are processed into a gene expression matrix that is then normalized and scaled to remove technical noise. Next, cells are grouped according to similarities in their patterns of gene expression, which can be summarized in two or three dimensions for visualization on a scatterplot. These data can then be further analysed to provide an in-depth view of the cell types or developmental trajectories in the sample of interest.},

We unraveled the molecular heterogeneity, developmental trajectories and regulatory networks of the major cell types. The results reveal that dorsal pancreatic multipotent cells in humans exhibit different gene expression patterns than ventral multipotent cells. Pancreato-biliary progenitors that generate ventral multipotent cells in humans were identified. Notch and MAPK signals from mesenchymal cells regulate the differentiation of multipotent cells into trunk and duct cells. Notably, we identified endocrine progenitor subclusters with different differentiation potentials. Although the developmental trajectories are largely conserved between humans and mice, some distinct gene expression patterns have also been identified.

	abstract = {Existing concepts and models for glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) are overviewed and a newer perspective has been formulated toward the physiological understanding of GSIS. A conventional model has been created on the basis of in vitro data on application of a square wave high glucose in the absence of any other stimulatory inputs. Glucose elicits rapid insulin release through an adenosine triphosphate‐sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel)‐dependent mechanism, which is gradually augmented in a KATP channel‐independent manner. Biphasic GSIS thus occurs. In the body, the β‐cells are constantly exposed to stimulatory signals, such as glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1), parasympathetic inputs, free fatty acid (FFA), amino acids and slightly suprathreshold levels of glucose, even at fasting. GLP‐1 increases cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, parasympathetic stimulation activates protein kinase C, and FFA, amino acids and glucose generate metabolic amplification factors. Plasma glucose concentration gradually rises postprandially under such tonic stimulation. We hypothesize that these stimulatory inputs together make the β‐cells responsive to glucose independently from its action on KATP channels. Robust GSIS in patients with a loss of function mutation of the sulfonylurea receptor, a subunit of KATP channels, is compatible with this hypothesis. Furthermore, pre‐exposure of the islets to an activator of protein kinase A and/or C makes β‐cells responsive to glucose in a KATP channel‐ and Ca2+‐independent manner. We hypothesize that GSIS occurs in islet β‐cells without glucose regulation of KATP channels in vivo, for which priming with cyclic adenosine monophosphate, protein kinase C and non‐glucose nutrients are required. To understand the physiology of GSIS, comprehensive integration of accumulated knowledge is required.},

However, the unfavourable pharmacokinetic profile and the weak biological effects of native GIP limit its effectiveness for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To overcome this, longer-acting GIP agonists exhibiting enzymatic stability and enhanced bioactivity have been generated and successfully tested in animal models of diabetes. Thus, GIP receptor agonists offer one of the newest classes of potential antidiabetic drug. GIP is also known to play a role in lipid metabolism and fat deposition. Accordingly, both genetic and chemical ablation of GIP signalling in mice with obesity-diabetes can protect against, or even reverse many of the obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. Strong parallels exist with the beneficial metabolic effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in obese, insulin-resistant humans that surgically ablates GIP-secreting K cells.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: There are a number of well-established methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) for automatically capturing systematic variation due to latent variables in large-scale genomic data. PCA and related methods may directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (PCs) (and other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting.
RESULTS: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of PCs. The proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance. We also analyze gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression data to provide a molecularly driven phenotype. Using our method, we find a greater enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis that uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. The proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quantifications of systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An R software package, called jackstraw, is available in CRAN.

            Comparative analysis of samples from two biological states, such as two stages of embryonic development, is a pressing problem in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). A key challenge is to detect cell subpopulations whose abundance differs between the two states. To that end, we develop DA-seq, a multiscale strategy to compare two cellular distributions. In contrast to existing unsupervised clustering-based analysis, DA-seq can delineate cell subpopulations with the most significant discrepancy between two states and potentially reveal important changes in cellular processes that are undetectable using conventional methods.
          , 
            
              Comprehensive and accurate comparisons of transcriptomic distributions of cells from samples taken from two different biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, are an emerging challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its
              k
              nearest neighboring cells across a range of
              k
              values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
          Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with diverse immune cell infiltration patterns, which has been linked to both, therapy sensitivity and resistance. However, full understanding of how immune cell phenotypes vary across different patient and tumor subgroups is lacking. Here, we dissect the NSCLC tumor microenvironment at high resolution by integrating 1,212,463 single-cells from 538 samples and 309 patients across 29 datasets, including our own dataset capturing cells with low mRNA content. Based on the cellular composition we stratified patients into immune deserted, B cell, T cell, and myeloid cell subtypes. Using bulk samples with genomic and clinical information, we identified specific cellular components associated with tumor histology and genotypes. Analysis of cells with low mRNA content uncovered distinct subpopulations of tissue-resident neutrophils (TRNs) that acquire new functional properties in the tissue microenvironment, providing evidence for the plasticity of TRNs. TRN-derived gene signature was associated with anti-PD-L1 treatment failure in a large NSCLC cohort.
          
            In brief
            Salcher, Sturm, Horvath et al. integrate single-cell datasets to generate the largest transcriptome atlas in NSCLC, refining patient stratification based on tumor immune phenotypes, and revealing associations of histological subtypes and genotypes with specific cellular composition patterns.
            
              Coverage of cells with low mRNA content by single-cell sequencing identifies distinct tissue-resident neutrophil subpopulations, which acquire new properties within the tumor microenvironment. Gene signature from tissue-resident neutrophils is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment failure. The integrated atlas is publicly available online (
              https://luca.icbi.at

            Single cell profiling has been proven to be a powerful tool in molecular biology to understand the complex behaviours of heterogeneous system. The definition of the properties of single cells is the primary endpoint of such analysis, cells are typically clustered to underpin the common determinants that can be used to describe functional properties of the cell mixture under investigation. Several approaches have been proposed to identify cell clusters; while this is matter of active research, one popular approach is based on community detection in neighbourhood graphs by optimisation of modularity. In this paper we propose an alternative and principled solution to this problem, based on Stochastic Block Models. We show that such approach not only is suitable for identification of cell groups, it also provides a solid framework to perform other relevant tasks in single cell analysis, such as label transfer. To encourage the use of Stochastic Block Models, we developed a python library, , that is compatible with the popular  framework.},

              Differential abundance (DA) analysis of microbiome data continues to be a challenging problem due to the complexity of the data. In this article we define the notion of “sampling fraction” and demonstrate a major hurdle in performing DA analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (
              ANCOM-BC
              ), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed‐normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing.

              Background
              Differences in cell-type composition across subjects and conditions often carry biological significance. Recent advancements in single cell sequencing technologies enable cell-types to be identified at the single cell level, and as a result, cell-type composition of tissues can now be studied in exquisite detail. However, a number of challenges remain with cell-type composition analysis – none of the existing methods can identify cell-type perfectly and variability related to cell sampling exists in any single cell experiment. This necessitates the development of method for estimating uncertainty in cell-type composition.
            
            
              Results
              We developed a novel single cell differential composition (scDC) analysis method that performs differential cell-type composition analysis via bootstrap resampling. scDC captures the uncertainty associated with cell-type proportions of each subject via bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals. We assessed the performance of our method using a number of simulated datasets and synthetic datasets curated from publicly available single cell datasets. In simulated datasets, scDC correctly recovered the true cell-type proportions. In synthetic datasets, the cell-type compositions returned by scDC were highly concordant with reference cell-type compositions from the original data. Since the majority of datasets tested in this study have only 2 to 5 subjects per condition, the addition of confidence intervals enabled better comparisons of compositional differences between subjects and across conditions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                scDC is a novel statistical method for performing differential cell-type composition analysis for scRNA-seq data. It uses bootstrap resampling to estimate the standard errors associated with cell-type proportion estimates and performs significance testing through GLM and GLMM models.

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.},

In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks.

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure.
Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement.
RESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis web-based tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists. Enrichr is open source and freely available online at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr.},

Differential Expression (DE) analysis is a major downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. DE analysis the in presence of noises from different sources remains a key challenge in scRNA-seq. Earlier practices for addressing this involved borrowing methods from bulk RNA-seq, which are based on non-zero differences in average expressions of genes across cell populations. Later, several methods specifically designed for scRNA-seq were developed. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to comprehensively study the performance of DE analysis methods. Here, we provide a review and classification of different DE approaches adapted from bulk RNA-seq practice as well as those specifically designed for scRNA-seq. We also evaluate the performance of 19 widely used methods in terms of 13 performance metrics on 11 real scRNA-seq datasets. Our findings suggest that some bulk RNA-seq methods are quite competitive with the single-cell methods and their performance depends on the underlying models, DE test statistic(s), and data characteristics. Further, it is difficult to obtain the method which will be best-performing globally through individual performance criterion. However, the multi-criteria and combined-data analysis indicates that DECENT and EBSeq are the best options for DE analysis. The results also reveal the similarities among the tested methods in terms of detecting common DE genes. Our evaluation provides proper guidelines for selecting the proper tool which performs best under particular experimental settings in the context of the scRNA-seq.},

	abstract = {With the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is possible to measure the expression dynamics of genes at the single-cell level. Through scRNA-seq, a huge amount of expression data for several thousand(s) of genes over million(s) of cells are generated in a single experiment. Differential expression analysis is the primary downstream analysis of such data to identify gene markers for cell type detection and also provide inputs to other secondary analyses. Many statistical approaches for differential expression analysis have been reported in the literature. Therefore, we critically discuss the underlying statistical principles of the approaches and distinctly divide them into six major classes, i.e., generalized linear, generalized additive, Hurdle, mixture models, two-class parametric, and non-parametric approaches. We also succinctly discuss the limitations that are specific to each class of approaches, and how they are addressed by other subsequent classes of approach. A number of challenges are identified in this study that must be addressed to develop the next class of innovative approaches. Furthermore, we also emphasize the methodological challenges involved in differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data that researchers must address to draw maximum benefit from this recent single-cell technology. This study will serve as a guide to genome researchers and experimental biologists to objectively select options for their analysis.},

However, strategies to integrate differential expression analysis of single-cell data remain underinvestigated. Here, we benchmark 46 workflows for differential expression analysis of single-cell data with multiple batches. We show that batch effects, sequencing depth and data sparsity substantially impact their performances. Notably, we find that the use of batch-corrected data rarely improves the analysis for sparse data, whereas batch covariate modeling improves the analysis for substantial batch effects. We show that for low depth data, single-cell techniques based on zero-inflation model deteriorate the performance, whereas the analysis of uncorrected data using limmatrend, Wilcoxon test and fixed effects model performs well. We suggest several high-performance methods under different conditions based on various simulation and real data analyses. Additionally, we demonstrate that differential expression analysis for a specific cell type outperforms that of large-scale bulk sample data in prioritizing disease-related genes.},

	abstract = {The standard analysis pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq data consists of sequential steps initiated by clustering the cells. An innate limitation of this pipeline is that an imperfect clustering result can irreversibly affect the succeeding steps. For example, there can be cell types not well distinguished by clustering because they largely share the global structure, such as the anterior primitive streak and mid primitive streak cells. If one searches differentially expressed genes (DEGs) solely based on clustering, marker genes for distinguishing these types will be missed. Moreover, clustering depends on many parameters and can often be subjective to manual decisions. To overcome these limitations, we propose MarcoPolo, a method that identifies informative DEGs independently of prior clustering. MarcoPolo sorts out genes by evaluating if the distributions are bimodal, if similar expression patterns are observed in other genes, and if the expressing cells are proximal in a low-dimensional space. Using real datasets with FACS-purified cell labels, we demonstrate that MarcoPolo recovers marker genes better than competing methods. Notably, MarcoPolo finds key genes that can distinguish cell types that are not distinguishable by the standard clustering. MarcoPolo is built in a convenient software package that provides analysis results in an HTML file.},

Our method uses Kullback–Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned in a multidimensional space. Comparisons with existing DEG prediction approaches on artificial datasets show that singleCellHaystack has higher accuracy. We illustrate the usage of singleCellHaystack through applications on 136 real transcriptome datasets and a spatial transcriptomics dataset. We demonstrate that our method is a fast and accurate approach for DEG prediction in single-cell data. singleCellHaystack is implemented as an R package and is available from CRAN and GitHub.},

We have implemented multiple online tools for effective GRN analysis, including differential TF–target network analysis, TF enrichment analysis, and pathway downstream analysis. We also provided details about TF binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes in GRNs.

Methods for inferring and reconstructing networks from genomics data have evolved rapidly over the last decade in response to advances in sequencing technology and machine learning. The scale of data collection has increased dramatically; the largest genome-wide gene expression datasets have grown from thousands of measurements to millions of single cells, and new technologies are on the horizon to increase to tens of millions of cells and above.In this work, we present the Inferelator 3.0, which has been significantly updated to integrate data from distinct cell types to learn context-specific regulatory networks and aggregate them into a shared regulatory network, while retaining the functionality of the previous versions. The Inferelator is able to integrate the largest single-cell datasets and learn cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks. Compared to other network inference methods, the Inferelator learns new and informative Saccharomyces cerevisiae networks from single-cell gene expression data, measured by recovery of a known gold standard. We demonstrate its scaling capabilities by learning networks for multiple distinct neuronal and glial cell types in the developing Mus musculus brain at E18 from a large (1.3 million) single-cell gene expression dataset with paired single-cell chromatin accessibility data.The inferelator software is available on GitHub (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/inferelator) under the MIT license and has been released as python packages with associated documentation (https://inferelator.readthedocs.io/).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unparalleled insight into the transcriptional programs of different cellular states by measuring the transcriptome of thousands of individual cells. An emerging problem in the analysis of scRNA-seq is the inference of transcriptional gene regulatory networks and a number of methods with different learning frameworks have been developed to address this problem. Here, we present an expanded benchmarking study of eleven recent network inference methods on seven published scRNA-seq datasets in human, mouse, and yeast considering different types of gold standard networks and evaluation metrics. We evaluate methods based on their computing requirements as well as on their ability to recover the network structure. We find that, while most methods have a modest recovery of experimentally derived interactions based on global metrics such as Area Under the Precision Recall curve, methods are able to capture targets of regulators that are relevant to the system under study. Among the top performing methods that use only expression were SCENIC, PIDC, MERLIN or Correlation. Addition of prior biological knowledge and the estimation of transcription factor activities resulted in the best overall performance with the Inferelator and MERLIN methods that use prior knowledge outperforming methods that use expression alone. We found that imputation for network inference did not improve network inference accuracy and could be detrimental. Comparisons of inferred networks for comparable bulk conditions showed that the networks inferred from scRNA-seq datasets are often better or at par with the networks inferred from bulk datasets. Our analysis should be beneficial in selecting methods for network inference. At the same time, this highlights the need for improved methods and better gold standards for regulatory network inference from scRNAseq datasets.},

Recently, the rapid advance of single-cell sequencing technologies, which pushed the limit of transcriptomic profiling to the individual cell level, opens up an entirely new area for regulatory network research. To exploit this new abundant source of data and take advantage of data in single-cell resolution, a number of computational methods have been proposed to uncover the interactions hidden by the averaging process in standard bulk sequencing. In this article, we review 15 such network inference methods developed for single-cell data. We discuss their underlying assumptions, inference techniques, usability, and pros and cons. In an extensive analysis using simulation, we also assess the methods’ performance, sensitivity to dropout and time complexity.

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

	abstract = {With the advent of recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, profiling single-cell sequencing became possible. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to characterize diverse cell populations and ascertain cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. The gene regulatory network (GRN) mainly consists of genes and their regulators—transcription factors (TF). Here, we describe the lightning-fast Python implementation of the SCENIC (Single-Cell reEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering) pipeline called pySCENIC. Using single-cell RNA-seq data, it maps TFs onto gene regulatory networks and integrates various cell types to infer cell-specific GRNs. There are two fast and efficient GRN inference algorithms, GRNBoost2 and GENIE3, optionally available with pySCENIC. The pipeline has three steps: (1) identification of potential TF targets based on co-expression; (2) TF-motif enrichment analysis to identify the direct targets (regulons); and (3) scoring the activity of regulons (or other gene sets) on single cell types.},

	abstract = {Liver disease is the spectrum of liver damage ranging from simple steatosis called as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinically, NAFLD and type 2 diabetes coexist. Type 2 diabetes contributes to biological processes driving the severity of NAFLD, the primary cause for development of chronic liver diseases. In the last 20 years, the rate of non-viral NAFLD/NASH-derived HCC has been increasing rapidly. As there are currently no suitable drugs for treatment of NAFLD and NASH, a class of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is sometimes used to improve liver failure despite the risk of side effects. Therefore, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are important issues. In this review, we will discuss the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH and NAFLD/NASH-derived HCC and the current promising pharmacological therapies of NAFLD/NASH. Further, we will provide insights into “adipose-derived adipokines” and “liver-derived hepatokines” as diagnostic and therapeutic targets from NAFLD to HCC.},

	abstract = {Low‐level of chronic inflammation activation is characteristic of obesity. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely linked to obesity and is an emerging health problem, it originates from abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, and sometimes causes inflammatory reactions that could contribute to cirrhosis and liver cancer, thus its pathogenesis needs to be clarified for more treatment options. Once NAFLD is established, it contributes to systemic inflammation, the low‐grade inflammation is continuously maintained during NAFLD causing impaired resolution of inflammation in obesity, which subsequently exacerbates its severity. This study focuses on the effects of obesity‐induced inflammations, which are the underlying causes of the disease progression and development of more severe inflammatory and fibrotic stages. Understanding the relationship between obesity and NAFLD could help in establishing attractive therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers in obesity‐induced inflammation response and provides new approaches for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in obesity., Obesity plays a vital role in the development of associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by affecting several inflammatory reactions via adipose tissue, vascular, intestinal, skeletal muscle, and brain, this process is associated with adipose tissue inflammation, inflammatory factors in the blood, intestinal inflammation, skeletal muscle inflammation, and brain tissue inflammation.},

Instead, adipocytes are also endocrine organs, with multiple metabolic roles in regulating whole-body physiology. Small adipocytes in lean individuals promote metabolic homeostasis; the enlarged adipocytes of obese individuals recruit macrophages and promote inflammation and the release of a range of factors that predispose toward insulin resistance. Exercise activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in muscle and other tissues, a pathway that increases fat oxidation and glucose transport. Importantly, the adipocyte hormones leptin and adiponectin also activate AMPK; remarkably, the same pathway is activated by certain antidiabetic agents such as thiazolidinediones. Increasingly, our understanding of the adipocyte as an endocrine organ is leading to new insights into obesity and health.},

	abstract = {Human T2D is characterized by a low-grade systemic inflammation, loss of β-cells, and diminished insulin production. Local islet immunity is still poorly understood, and hence, we evaluated macrophage subpopulations in pancreatic islets in the well-established murine model of T2D, the db/db mouse. Already at 8 weeks of disease, on average, 12 macrophages were observed in the diabetic islets, whereas only two were recorded in the nondiabetic littermates. On a detailed level, the islet resident macrophages increased fourfold compared with nondiabetic littermates, whereas a pronounced recruitment (eightfold) of a novel subset of macrophages (CD68+F4/80-) was observed. The majority of the CD68+F4/80+ but only 40\% of the CD68+F4/80- islet macrophages expressed CD11b. Both islet-derived macrophage subsets expressed moderate MHC-II, high galectin-3, and low CD80/CD86 levels, suggesting the cells to be macrophages rather than DCs. On a functional level, the vast majority of the macrophages in the diabetic islets was of the proinflammatory, M1-like phenotype. The systemic immunity in diabetic animals was characterized by a low-grade inflammation with elevated cytokine levels and increase of splenic cytokine, producing CD68+F4/80- macrophages. In late-stage diabetes, the cytokine signature changed toward a TGF-β-dominated profile, coinciding with a significant increase of galectin-3-positive macrophages in the spleen. In summary, our results show that proinflammatory M1-like galectin-3+ CD80/CD86(low) macrophages invade diabetic islets. Moreover, the innate immunity matures in a diabetes-dependent manner from an initial proinflammatory toward a profibrotic phenotype, supporting the concept that T2D is an inflammatory disease.},

We provide a formal definition of tissue homeostasis as a collection of circuits that regulate specific variables within the tissue environment, and we describe how the functional organization of tissues allows for the maintenance of both tissue and systemic homeostasis. This leads to a natural definition of inflammation as a response to deviations from homeostasis that cannot be reversed by homeostatic mechanisms alone. We describe how inflammatory signals act on the same cellular functions involved in normal tissue organization and homeostasis in order to coordinate emergency responses to perturbations and ultimately return the system to a homeostatic state. Finally, we consider the hierarchy of homeostatic and inflammatory circuits and the implications for the development of inflammatory diseases.},

We explore the effects of such inflammation in metabolic tissues including adipose, liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain and its contribution to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Another area in which many unknowns still exist is the origin or mechanism of initiation of inflammatory signaling in obesity.

Despite this widely confirmed paradigm, numerous open questions and knowledge gaps remain to be investigated. This is mainly due to the intricately intertwined cross-talk of various pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling cascades involved in the immune response of expanding adipose depots, particularly the visceral adipose tissue. Adipose tissue inflammation is initiated and sustained over time by dysfunctional adipocytes that secrete inflammatory adipokines and by infiltration of bone marrow-derived immune cells that signal via production of cytokines and chemokines. Despite its low-grade nature, adipose tissue inflammation negatively impacts remote organ function, a phenomenon that is considered causative of the complications of obesity. The aim of this review is to broadly present an overview of adipose tissue inflammation by highlighting the most recent reports in the scientific literature and summarizing our overall understanding of the field. We also discuss key endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators and analyze their mechanistic role(s) in the pathogenesis and treatment of adipose tissue inflammation.

These include recruitment of tnfα-expressing macrophages and the activation of NF-kB signaling in beta-cells. Using a transgenic reporter, we show that NF-kB activity is undetectable in juvenile beta-cells, whereas cells from older fish exhibit heterogeneous NF-kB activity. We link this heterogeneity to differences in gene expression and proliferation. Beta-cells with high NF-kB signaling proliferate significantly less compared to their neighbors with low activity. The NF-kB signalinghi cells also exhibit premature upregulation of socs2, an age-related gene that inhibits beta-cell proliferation. Together, our results show that NF-kB activity marks the asynchronous decline in beta-cell proliferation with advancing age.},

	abstract = {Ageing and age-related diseases share some basic mechanistic pillars that largely converge on inflammation. During ageing, chronic, sterile, low-grade inflammation — called inflammaging — develops, which contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related diseases. From an evolutionary perspective, a variety of stimuli sustain inflammaging, including pathogens (non-self), endogenous cell debris and misplaced molecules (self) and nutrients and gut microbiota (quasi-self). A limited number of receptors, whose degeneracy allows them to recognize many signals and to activate the innate immune responses, sense these stimuli. In this situation, metaflammation (the metabolic inflammation accompanying metabolic diseases) is thought to be the form of chronic inflammation that is driven by nutrient excess or overnutrition; metaflammation is characterized by the same mechanisms underpinning inflammaging. The gut microbiota has a central role in both metaflammation and inflammaging owing to its ability to release inflammatory products, contribute to circadian rhythms and crosstalk with other organs and systems. We argue that chronic diseases are not only the result of ageing and inflammaging; these diseases also accelerate the ageing process and can be considered a manifestation of accelerated ageing. Finally, we propose the use of new biomarkers (DNA methylation, glycomics, metabolomics and lipidomics) that are capable of assessing biological versus chronological age in metabolic diseases.},

	abstract = {Most older individuals develop inflammageing, a condition characterized by elevated levels of blood inflammatory markers that carries high susceptibility to chronic morbidity, disability, frailty, and premature death. Potential mechanisms of inflammageing include genetic susceptibility, central obesity, increased gut permeability, changes to microbiota composition, cellular senescence, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, oxidative stress caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, immune cell dysregulation, and chronic infections. Inflammageing is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and clinical trials suggest that this association is causal. Inflammageing is also a risk factor for chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, depression, dementia, and sarcopenia, but whether modulating inflammation beneficially affects the clinical course of non-CVD health problems is controversial. This uncertainty is an important issue to address because older patients with CVD are often affected by multimorbidity and frailty — which affect clinical manifestations, prognosis, and response to treatment — and are associated with inflammation by mechanisms similar to those in CVD. The hypothesis that inflammation affects CVD, multimorbidity, and frailty by inhibiting growth factors, increasing catabolism, and interfering with homeostatic signalling is supported by mechanistic studies but requires confirmation in humans. Whether early modulation of inflammageing prevents or delays the onset of cardiovascular frailty should be tested in clinical trials.},

Diseases are more severe in elderly than in young individuals and have a greater impact on health outcomes such as morbidity, disability and mortality. Aging is characterized by increased low-grade chronic inflammation, called “inflammaging”, measured by circulating levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and CRP, as well as by latent infections with viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). Inflammaging has received considerable attention because it proposes a link between changes in immune cells and a number of diseases and syndromes typical of old age. In this review we aim at summarizing the current knowledge on pathways contributing to inflammaging, on immune responses down-regulated by inflammation and mechanisms proposed. The defects in the immune response of elderly individuals presented in this review should help to discover avenues for effective intervention to promote healthy aging.},

	abstract = {In this paper we extend the "network theory of aging," and we argue that a global reduction in the capacity to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status are major characteristics of the aging process. This phenomenon, which we will refer to as "inflamm-aging," is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. On the basis of evolutionary studies, we also argue that the immune and the stress responses are equivalent and that antigens are nothing other than particular types of stressors. We also propose to return macrophage to its rightful place as central actor not only in the inflammatory response and immunity, but also in the stress response. The rate of reaching the threshold of proinflammatory status over which diseases/disabilities ensue and the individual capacity to cope with and adapt to stressors are assumed to be complex traits with a genetic component. Finally, we argue that the persistence of inflammatory stimuli over time represents the biologic background (first hit) favoring the susceptibility to age-related diseases/disabilities. A second hit (absence of robust gene variants and/or presence of frail gene variants) is likely necessary to develop overt organ-specific age-related diseases having an inflammatory pathogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Following this perspective, several paradoxes of healthy centenarians (increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and coagulation factors) are illustrated and explained. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.},

	abstract = {While the incidence of diabetes increases with age, a decrease in beta-cell function independent of age-related insulin resistance has not been conclusively determined. We studied insulin secretion (by hyperglycemic clamp) in 3-, 9-, and 20-month-old chronically catheterized, awake, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n = 78). Insulin action was modulated in a group of old rats by caloric restriction (CR) or by surgical removal of visceral fat (VF-). During the first 2 h of the clamp (11 mmol/l glucose), insulin secretion and insulin resistance (S(i hyper clamp)) demonstrated the characteristic hyperbolic relationship. However, after hyperglycemia for an additional 2 h, the ability to maintain insulin secretion, commensurate with the degree of insulin resistance, was decreased in all aging rats (P {\textless} 0.05). Increasing plasma glucose levels to 18 mmol/l glucose, after clamp at 11 mmol/l, increased insulin secretion by approximately threefold in young rats, but failed to induce similar magnitude of response in the aging rats ( approximately 50\%). However, elevation of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels by twofold (by intralipid infusion during 11 mmol/l glucose clamp) resulted in a robust, approximate twofold response in both young and old rats. Thus, prolonged stimulation by hyperglycemia unveiled a functional defect in insulin secretion with aging. This age-related defect is independent of insulin action and is specific to glucose and not FFAs. We suggest that prolonged hyperglycemic stimulation can be a tool to identify functional defects in insulin secretion, particularly in the context of the hyperbolic relationship with insulin action, in elderly subjects or those at risk for type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis
Ageing is a major risk factor for development of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Identification of the mechanisms underlying this association could help to elucidate the relationship between age-associated progressive loss of metabolic health and development of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine molecular signatures during ageing in the endocrine pancreas.

Methods
Global gene transcription was measured in pancreatic islets isolated from young and old rats by Ilumina BeadChip arrays. Promoter DNA methylation was measured by Sequenom MassArray in 46 genes that showed differential expression with age, and correlations with expression were established. Alterations in morphological and cellular processes with age were determined by immunohistochemical methods.

Results
Age-related changes in gene expression were found at 623 loci ({\textgreater}1.5-fold, false discovery rate [FDR] {\textless}5\%), with a significant (FDR {\textless} 0.05) enrichment in genes previously implicated in islet-cell function (Enpp1, Abcc8), type 2 diabetes (Tspan8, Kcnq1), inflammatory processes (Cxcl9, Il33) and extracellular matrix organisation (Col3a1, Dpt). Age-associated transcriptional differences negatively correlated with promoter DNA methylation at several loci related to inflammation, glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and cell–matrix interactions (Il33, Cxcl9, Gpr119, Fbp2, Col3a1, Dpt, Spp1).

Conclusions/interpretation
Our findings suggest that a significant proportion of pancreatic islets develop a low-grade ‘chronic’ inflammatory status with ageing and this may trigger altered functional plasticity. Furthermore, we identified changes in expression of genes previously linked to type 2 diabetes and associated changes in DNA methylation that could explain their age-associated dysregulation. These findings provide new insights into key (epi)genetic signatures of the ageing process in islets.

	abstract = {Purpose
This study aimed to uncover novel cell types in heterogenous basal limbus of human cornea for identifying LSC at single cell resolution.
Methods
Single cells of human limbal basal epithelium were isolated from young donor corneas. Single-cell RNA-Sequencing was performed using 10x Genomics platform, followed by clustering cell types through the graph-based visualization method UMAP and unbiased computational informatic analysis. Tissue RNA in situ hybridization with RNAscope, immunofluorescent staining and multiple functional assays were performed using human corneas and limbal epithelial culture models.
Results
Single-cell transcriptomics of 16,360 limbal basal cells revealed 12 cell clusters belonging to three lineages. A smallest cluster (0.4\% of total cells) was identified as LSCs based on their quiescent and undifferentiated states with enriched marker genes for putative epithelial stem cells. TSPAN7 and SOX17 are discovered and validated as new LSC markers based on their exclusive expression pattern and spatial localization in limbal basal epithelium by RNAscope and immunostaining, and functional role in cell growth and tissue regeneration models with RNA interference in cultures. Interestingly, five cell types/states mapping a developmental trajectory of LSC from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation are uncovered by Monocle3 and CytoTRACE pseudotime analysis. The transcription factor networks linking novel signaling pathways are revealed to maintain LSC stemness.
Conclusions
This human corneal scRNA-Seq identifies the LSC population and uncovers novel cell types mapping the differentiation trajectory in heterogenous limbal basal epithelium. The findings provide insight into LSC concept and lay the foundation for understanding the corneal homeostasis and diseases.},

Here, we combine published mouse striatal single-cell datasets from both embryonic and postnatal timepoints to analyze the developmental trajectory patterns and transcription factor regulatory networks within striatal cell types. Using this integrated dataset, we found that dopamine receptor-1 expressing spiny projection neurons have an extended period of transcriptional dynamics and greater transcriptional complexity over postnatal development compared to dopamine receptor-2 expressing neurons. Moreover, we found the transcription factor, FOXP1, exerts indirect changes to oligodendrocytes. These data can be accessed and further analyzed through an interactive website (https://mouse-striatal-dev.cells.ucsc.edu).},

Single-cell RNA sequencing is one of the most powerful tools to study complex diseases such as cancer, and despite its recent emergence, it’s rapidly growing. In contrast to bulk RNA sequencing, which averages out expression of thousands of cells, single-cell RNA sequencing can capture intra-tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, cellular dynamic events like progression can be studied by pseudotime trajectory analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Herein we used Samsung Medical Center (SMC) colorectal cancer single-cell RNA sequencing dataset to find important tumor epithelial cells subtypes. Subsequently, we’ve found important genes with a dynamic pattern along cancer progression by using pseudo-time trajectory analysis. Also, we found TGFB1 and IL1B as effective ligands and several transcription factors which may regulate the expression of pseudo-time related genes.

PAGA maps preserve the global topology of data, allow analyzing data at different resolutions, and result in much higher computational efficiency of the typical exploratory data analysis workflow.

While many methods have been developed to infer the pseudotemporal trajectories of cells within a biological sample, it remains a challenge to compare pseudotemporal patterns with multiple samples (or replicates) across different experimental conditions. Here, we introduce Lamian, a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. Lamian can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions while adjusting for batch effects, and to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory. Unlike existing methods that ignore sample variability, Lamian draws statistical inference after accounting for cross-sample variability and hence substantially reduces sample-specific false discoveries that are not generalizable to new samples. Using both real scRNA-seq and simulation data, including an analysis of differential immune response programs between COVID-19 patients with different disease severity levels, we demonstrate the advantages of Lamian in decoding cellular gene expression programs in continuous biological processes.},

Trajectory and gene regulatory analyses capture 36 transcription factors, including a circadian regulator, Bhlhe40, in programming liver development. Remarkably, we identiﬁed a special group of macrophages enriched at day 7 with a hybrid phenotype of macrophages and endothelial cells, which may regulate sinusoidal construction and Treg-cell function.

	abstract = {An immunosuppressive microenvironment enriched with regulatory CD4+ T lymphocytes (Tregs) facilitates the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This study aims to investigate the cellular mechanism underlying the formation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in LUAD. LUAD samples (n = 12) and normal lung samples (n = 3) were obtained from patients with different pathological stages of LUAD. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to classify cellular components and analyze the transcriptomes, including transcription factors/targets and chemokine ligands/receptors, followed by bioinformatics study such as pseudotime analysis. Myeloid cells and T cells were the most abundant cell types in tumors and normal lung tissues, while tumor-associated macrophage-folate receptor 2 (TAM-FOLR2) and CD4+ nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3 (NR4A3) exhibited sharp increases in invasive adenocarcinoma (IA). The enrichment of TAM-FOLR2 in IA might result from alveolar resident macrophage-resistin (ARM-RETN) transformation and recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) and other TAMs, as evidenced by temporal trajectories and differential expression profiles of chemokine ligands/receptors versus those in the early stages of tumors. High expression of CCL17/19/22 was observed in IA as well as in DCs, along with the strong interaction of TAM-FOLR2 with DCs. The results of pseudotime analysis suggested that CD4+NR4A3 might potentially convert to CD4+FOXP3, further supported by the high expression of NR4A3 target genes in CD4+FOXP3 cells. This study provides a single-cell transcriptome atlas from preinvasive to invasive LUAD and reveals a potential ARM-RETN/TAM-FOLR2/DCs/CD4+NR4A3/CD4+FOXP3 trajectory in shaping the immune suppressive microenvironment along the pathogenesis of LUAD.},

We demonstrate the depletion of anti-tumoural immune subsets and accumulation of immunosuppressive or exhausted subsets along with reduced tumour infiltration of CD8 T cells peaking at stage II tumours. Corresponding transcriptomic modification occur in the genes related to antigen presentation, immune responses, and chemotaxis. The progressive immune evasion is validated in a murine model of HCC.

Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from uninfected controls and COVID-19 patients and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased dendritic cells (DCs) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8+ T cell subsets, compared to healthy controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4+ T cell subsets among the T cell compartment, including Th1, Th2, and Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients’ peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4, CCL5, etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant recruitment of peripheral T cells to the severe patients’ lung.

Here we present Scriabin, a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of cell–cell communication at single-cell resolution that is performed without cell aggregation or downsampling. We use multiple published atlas-scale datasets, genetic perturbation screens and direct experimental validation to show that Scriabin accurately recovers expected cell–cell communication edges and identifies communication networks that can be obscured by agglomerative methods. Additionally, we use spatial transcriptomic data to show that Scriabin can uncover spatial features of interaction from dissociated data alone. Finally, we demonstrate applications to longitudinal datasets to follow communication pathways operating between timepoints. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to reveal the full structure of niche–phenotype relationships in health and disease.},

In this study we report the use of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to compile a Human Breast Cell Atlas (HBCA) assembled from 55 donors that had undergone reduction mammoplasties or risk reduction mammoplasties. The data from more than 800,000 cells identified 41 cell subclusters distributed across the epithelial, immune, and stromal compartments. We found that the contribution of these different clusters varied according to the natural history of the tissue. Breast cancer risk modulating factors such as age, parity, and germline mutation affected the homeostatic cellular state of the breast in different ways however, none of the changes observed were restricted to any one cell type. Remarkably, we also found that immune cells from BRCA1/2 carriers had a distinct gene expression signature indicative of potential immune exhaustion. This suggests that immune escape mechanisms could manifest in non-cancerous tissues during very early stages of tumour initiation. Therefore, the Atlas presented here provides the research community with a rich resource that can be used as a reference for studies on the origins of breast cancer which could inform novel approaches for early detection and prevention.},

	abstract = {Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for regulating body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis. The ability of thermogenic adipocytes to dissipate chemical energy as heat counteracts weight gain and has gained considerable attention as a strategy against obesity. BAT undergoes major remodeling in a cold environment. This remodeling results from changes in the number and function of brown adipocytes, expanding the network of blood vessels and sympathetic nerves, and changes in the composition and function of immune cells. Such synergistic adaptation requires extensive crosstalk between individual cells in the tissue to coordinate their responses. To understand the mechanisms of intercellular communication in BAT, we apply the CellChat algorithm to single-cell transcriptomic data of mouse BAT. We construct an integrative network of the ligand-receptor interactome in BAT and identify the major signaling inputs and outputs of each cell type. By comparing the ligand-receptor interactions in BAT of mice housed at different environmental temperatures, we show that cold exposure enhances the intercellular interactions among the major cell types in BAT, including adipocytes, adipocyte progenitors, lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells, myelinated and non-myelinated Schwann cells, and immune cells. These interactions are predicted to regulate the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and neurite growth. Together, our integrative analysis of intercellular communications in BAT and their dynamic regulation in response to housing temperatures provides a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying BAT thermogenesis. The resources presented in this study offer a valuable platform for future investigations of BAT development and thermogenesis., Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data using the CellChat algorithm reveal that changes in the ambient temperature elicit comprehensive alterations of cellcell communications in murine brown adipose tissue},

Some patients do benefit from anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy; however, a large number of patients do not have response or acquire drug resistance after treatment. Moreover, anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy may lead to nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular-related side effects due to its action on normal ECs. Therefore, it is necessary to identify targets that are specific to tumor ECs and could be applied to various cancer types. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from six cancer types and constructed a multi-cancer EC atlas to decode the characteristic of tumor ECs. We found that tip-like ECs mainly exist in tumor tissues but barely exist in normal tissues. Tip-like ECs are involved in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis and inhibition on anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, tumor cells, myeloid cells, and pericytes are the main sources of pro-angiogenic factors. High proportion of tip-like ECs is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. We also identified that prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a specific marker for tip-like ECs in all the cancer types we studied. In summary, we demonstrate that tip-like ECs are the main differential EC subcluster between tumors and normal tissues.

However, subgroups manifested similar lipid metabolic patterns, immunosuppressive functions and TFs module at the end of the differentiation trajectory in CD8+ T cells, myeloid cells and Fibroblasts. Meanwhile, TFs regulated lipid metabolism and immunosuppressive ligand-receptor pairs were detected by tracing the differentiation trajectory. Based on the cell subgroup fractions calculated by CIBERSORTx and bulk RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we constructed an immune risk model and clinical risk model of CRC which presented excellent prognostic value.ConclusionThis study identified that the differentiation was accompanied by remodeling of lipid metabolism and suppression of immune function, which suggest that lipid remodeling may be an important trigger of immunosuppression. More importantly, our work provides a new perspective for understanding the heterogeneity and convergence of the TME and will aid the development of prognosis and immunotherapies of CRC patients.},

Phenotypic plasticity is emerging as a crucial feature across multiple axes of cancer progression. Cells undergoing the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) can fall into intermediate or hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) cell states. Moreover, cancer cells across the EMT spectrum can exhibit the traits of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and communicate through several cell-cell signaling pathways. By integrating multiple analytical tools into a single computational framework, we investigated several single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets and identified the emerging relationship between EMT, acquisition of CSC traits, and cell–cell communication. Our integrated analysis shows that the increase of EM plasticity correlates with high expression of CSC markers as well as intensification of cell–cell signaling between cancer cells. Furthermore, these observations are consistent across different cancer types and anatomical locations. Overall, our results shine light onto the interconnected and multi-dimensional landscape of cancer progression.

Abstract
Intermediate cell states (ICSs) during the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) are emerging as a driving force of cancer invasion and metastasis. ICSs typically exhibit hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal characteristics as well as cancer stem cell (CSC) traits including proliferation and drug resistance. Here, we analyze several single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets to investigate the relation between several axes of cancer progression including EMT, CSC traits, and cell–cell signaling. To accomplish this task, we integrate computational methods for clustering and trajectory inference with analysis of EMT gene signatures, CSC markers, and cell–cell signaling pathways, and highlight conserved and specific processes across the datasets. Our analysis reveals that “standard” measures of pluripotency often used in developmental contexts do not necessarily correlate with EMT progression and expression of CSC-related markers. Conversely, an EMT circuit energy that quantifies the co-expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes consistently increases along EMT trajectories across different cancer types and anatomical locations. Moreover, despite the high context specificity of signal transduction across different cell types, cells undergoing EMT always increased their potential to send and receive signals from other cells.},

However, the differentiation trajectories and underlying molecular mechanisms of CAFs in PDAC early invasion have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we integrated and reanalysed single-cell data from the National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC) database and confirmed that myofibroblast-like CAFs (myCAFs) mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and enhanced the invasion abilities of PDAC cells by secreting regulators of angiogenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, we constructed a differentiation trajectory of CAFs and revealed that reprogramming from iCAFs to myCAFs was associated with poor prognosis. Mechanistically, SOX4 was aberrantly activated in myCAFs, which promoted the secretion of MMP11 and eventually induced early cancer cell invasion. Together, our results provide a comprehensive transcriptomic overview of PDAC patients with early invasion and reveal the intercellular crosstalk between myCAFs and cancer cells, which suggests potential targets for early invasion PDAC therapy.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell maturation is lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics, and histological and ultrastructural analyses, we show that an ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the brain vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells follow distinct developmental trajectories and utilize diverse signaling mechanisms, including Collagen, Laminin, and Midkine, to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation. Interestingly, our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of endothelial cells, are highly enriched near the ventricular zone, the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical organoids exhibit restricted lineage potential that favors tip cells, promote neurogenesis, and reduce cellular stress. Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular maturation during this critical period of human brain development.,

Therefore, it is necessary to systematically explore brain cell communications when considering factors such as sex and brain region. Methods We extracted a total of 1,039,459 cells derived from 28 brain single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets from the GEO database, including 12 human and 16 mouse datasets. These datasets were further divided into 71 new sub-datasets when considering disease, sex, and region conditions. In the meanwhile, we integrated four methods to evaluate ligand–receptor interaction score among six major brain cell types (microglia, neuron, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, OPC, and endothelial cell). Results For Alzheimer's disease (AD), disease-specific ligand–receptor pairs when compared with normal sub-datasets, such as SEMA4A-NRP1, were identified. Furthermore, we explored the sex- and region-specific cell communications and identified that WNT5A-ROR1 among microglia cells displayed close communications in male, and SPP1-ITGAV displayed close communications in the meninges region from microglia to neurons. Furthermore, based on the AD-specific cell communications, we constructed a model for AD early prediction and confirmed the predictive performance using multiple independent datasets. Finally, we developed an online platform for researchers to explore brain condition-specific cell communications. Conclusion This research provided a comprehensive study to explore brain cell communications, which could reveal novel biological mechanisms involved in normal brain function and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.},

Despite bulk studies focusing on intracellular mechanisms of PD inside DaNs, few studies have explored the pathogeneses outside DaNs, or between DaNs and other cells. Here, we set out to probe the implication of intercellular communication involving DaNs in the pathogeneses of PD at a systemic level with bioinformatics methods. We harvested three online published single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) datasets of human SN (GSE126838, GSE140231, and GSE157783) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and integrated them with one of the latest integration algorithms called Harmony. We then applied CellChat, the latest cell–cell communication analytic algorithm, to our integrated dataset. We first found that the overall communication quantity was decreased while the overall communication strength was enhanced in PD sample compared with control sample. We then focused on the intercellular communication where DaNs are involved, and found that the communications between DaNs and other cell types via certain signaling pathways were selectively altered in PD, including some growth factors, neurotrophic factors, chemokines, etc. pathways. Our bioinformatics analysis showed that the alteration in intercellular communications involving DaNs might be a previously underestimated aspect of PD pathogeneses with novel translational potential.},

Nowadays both T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing technology have emerged with the maturity of NGS technology. However, both SLE and RA peripheral blood TCR or BCR repertoire sequencing remains lacking because repertoire sequencing is an expensive assay and consumes valuable tissue samples. This study used computational methods TRUST4 to construct TCR repertoire and BCR repertoire from bulk RNA-seq data of both SLE and RA patients’ peripheral blood and analyzed the clonality and diversity of the immune repertoire between the two diseases. Although the functions of immune cells have been studied, the mechanism is still complicated. Differentially expressed genes in each immune cell type and cell–cell interactions between immune cell clusters have not been covered. In this work, we clustered eight immune cell subsets from original scRNA-seq data and disentangled the characteristic alterations of cell subset proportion under both SLE and RA conditions. The cell–cell communication analysis tool CellChat was also utilized to analyze the influence of MIF family and GALECTIN family cytokines, which were reported to regulate SLE and RA, respectively. Our findings correspond to previous findings that MIF increases in the serum of SLE patients. This work proved that the presence of LGALS9, PTPRC and CD44 in platelets could serve as a clinical indicator of rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings comprehensively illustrate dynamic alterations in immune cells during pathogenesis of SLE and RA. This work identified specific V genes and J genes in TCR and BCR that could be used to expand our understanding of SLE and RA. These findings provide a new insight inti the diagnosis and treatment of the two autoimmune diseases.},

Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady-state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed pre-programmed cell-type hierarchy.

Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive methods are still required. We adapted a previously developed strategy for single-cell RNA-Seq that has shown promise for superior sensitivity and implemented the chemistry in a microfluidic platform for single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis. In this approach, single cells are captured and lysed in a microfluidic device, where mRNAs with poly(A) tails are reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA is then collected and sequenced using a next generation sequencing platform. We prepared 94 libraries consisting of single mouse embryonic cells and technical replicates of extracted RNA and thoroughly characterized the performance of this technology. Microfluidic implementation increased mRNA detection sensitivity as well as improved measurement precision compared with tube-based protocols. With 0.2 M reads per cell, we were able to reconstruct a majority of the bulk transcriptome with 10 single cells. We also quantified variation between and within different types of mouse embryonic cells and found that enhanced measurement precision, detection sensitivity, and experimental throughput aided the distinction between biological variability and technical noise. With this work, we validated the advantages of an early approach to single-cell RNA-Seq and showed that the benefits of combining microfluidic technology with high-throughput sequencing will be valuable for large-scale efforts in single-cell transcriptome analysis.},

Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

Samples with high ambient RNA concentration can create challenges in accurately distinguishing cell-containing droplets and droplets containing ambient RNA.

Additionally, there are currently no methods available to detect droplets containing damaged cells, which comprise partially lysed cells, the original source of the ambient RNA.},

We observe that snRNA-seq is commonly subject to contamination by high amounts of ambient RNA, which can lead to biased downstream analyses, such as identification of spurious cell types if overlooked. We present a novel approach to quantify contamination and filter droplets in snRNA-seq experiments, called Debris Identification using Expectation Maximization (DIEM). Our likelihood-based approach models the gene expression distribution of debris and cell types, which are estimated using EM. We evaluated DIEM using three snRNA-seq data sets: (1) human differentiating preadipocytes in vitro, (2) fresh mouse brain tissue, and (3) human frozen adipose tissue (AT) from six individuals. All three data sets showed evidence of extranuclear RNA contamination, and we observed that existing methods fail to account for contaminated droplets and led to spurious cell types. When compared to filtering using these state of the art methods, DIEM better removed droplets containing high levels of extranuclear RNA and led to higher quality clusters. Although DIEM was designed for snRNA-seq, our clustering strategy also successfully filtered single-cell RNA-seq data. To conclude, our novel method DIEM removes debris-contaminated droplets from single-cell-based data fast and effectively, leading to cleaner downstream analysis.

	abstract = {Droplet-based single-cell assays, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), generate considerable background noise counts, the hallmark of which is nonzero counts in cell-free droplets and off-target gene expression in unexpected cell types. Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package CellBender. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that CellBender operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types.},

	abstract = {Background
Plasma insulin levels are predominantly the product of the morphological mass of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and the functional status of each of these beta cells. Thus, deficiency in either beta cell mass or function, or both, can lead to insufficient levels of insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia and diabetes. Nonetheless, the precise contribution of beta cell mass and function to the pathogenesis of diabetes as well as the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In the past, this was largely due to the restricted number of technologies suitable for studying the scarcely accessible human beta cells. However, in recent years, a number of new platforms have been established to expand the available techniques and to facilitate deeper insight into the role of human beta cell mass and function as cause for diabetes and as potential treatment targets.
Scope of Review
This review discusses the current knowledge about contribution of human beta cell mass and function to different stages of type 1 and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Furthermore, it highlights standard and newly developed technological platforms for the study of human beta cell biology, which can be used to increase our understanding of beta cell mass and function in human glucose homeostasis.
Major Conclusions
In contrast to early disease models, recent studies suggest that in type 1 and type 2 diabetes impairment of beta cell function is an early feature of disease pathogenesis while a substantial decrease in beta cell mass occurs more closely to clinical manifestation. This suggests that, in addition to beta cell mass replacement for late stage therapies, the development of novel strategies for protection and recovery of beta cell function could be most promising for successful diabetes treatment and prevention. The use of today's developing and wide range of technologies and platforms for the study of human beta cells will allow for a more detailed investigation of the underlying mechanisms and will facilitate development of treatment approaches to specifically target human beta cell mass and function.},

	abstract = {The proteome of a human cell is partitioned within organelles, such as the nucleus, and other subcellular compartments, such as the cytoplasm, forming a myriad of membrane-bound and membrane-free ultrastructures. This compartmentalization allows discrete biochemical processes to occur efficiently in isolation, with relevant proteins localized to appropriate niches to fulfill their biological function(s). Proper delivery and dynamic exchange of proteins between compartments underlie the regulation of many cellular processes, such as cell signaling, division, and programmed cell death. To this end, cells deploy dedicated trafficking mechanisms to ensure correct protein localization, as mis-localization can result in pathology. In addition to trafficking, variation in the expression, modification, and physical associations of proteins within and between cells can result in biological heterogeneity, motivating the need for single-cell measurements. In this review, we introduce diverse platform technologies developed for subcellular proteomics and high-throughput systems biology, with the aim of providing mechanistic insights into fundamental cell biological processes underlying healthy and diseased states, and valuable public data resources. In contrast to the rapidly advancing field of single-cell genomics, the single-cell spatial proteomics toolbox remains in its infancy, but is poised to make considerable advances in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Methods for tracing lineage can be divided into two groups. Prospective methods trace lineage forwards from the application of an experimentally delivered marker, and retrospective methods trace lineage backwards, using endogenous marks that naturally accumulate in the genome.Early methods using sparse retroviral labelling for prospective lineage tracing have given way to retroviral barcodes of essentially unlimited complexity, allowing the labelling and recovery of large populations of cells for lineage tracing experiments.Genetic recombination with Cre-loxP or engineered transposon systems is a popular method for lineage tracing in genetically accessible model organisms. Recent work has demonstrated that CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing is a promising way to track and synthetically reconstruct cell lineage relationships in complex multicellular organisms, and may supplement or supplant older recombination-based systems in the future.Recent advances in single-cell genome amplification and sequencing make it possible to harness naturally occurring somatic mutations to infer cell lineage information retrospectively. Somatic mutations of many classes, including long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1; also known as LINE-1) retrotransposition events, copy-number variants, single-nucleotide variants and microsatellite length variants, are appropriate for lineage tracing.Single-cell genome-sequencing experiments require genome amplification, and investigators must consider the frequencies and types of errors that are introduced by different amplification methods to select an approach that best balances signal and noise for the experiment at hand.When designing a lineage tracing experiment, it is important to consider the strengths and weaknesses of either a prospective or a retrospective approach. Prospective approaches require genetic access to the cell population being labelled, but can often be higher throughput and less expensive than retrospective approaches. Retrospective approaches use marks that accumulate in the genome, making any purifiable population accessible to analysis, but can be low-throughput and expensive.},

However, analysis of single cell DNA sequencing data remains challenging due to bias and artifacts that arise during DNA extraction and whole-genome amplification, including allelic imbalance and dropout. Here, we present a framework for statistical estimation of allele-specific amplification imbalance at any given position in single cell whole-genome sequencing data by utilizing the allele frequencies of heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the neighborhood. The resulting allelic imbalance profile is critical for determining whether the variant allele fraction of an observed mutation is consistent with the expected fraction for a true variant. This method, implemented in SCAN-SNV (Single Cell ANalysis of SNVs), substantially improves the identification of somatic variants in single cells. Our allele balance framework is broadly applicable to genotype analysis of any variant type in any data that might exhibit allelic imbalance.},

By contrast, A and B compartments, lamina-associated domains and active enhancers and promoters are organized in a consistent way on a genome-wide basis in every cell, suggesting that they could drive chromosome and genome folding.

	abstract = {Methods for quantifying gene expression1 and chromatin accessibility2 in single cells are well established, but single-cell analysis of chromatin regions with specific histone modifications has been technically challenging. In this study, we adapted the CUT\&Tag method3 to scalable nanowell and droplet-based single-cell platforms to profile chromatin landscapes in single cells (scCUT\&Tag) from complex tissues and during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. We focused on profiling polycomb group (PcG) silenced regions marked by histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in single cells as an orthogonal approach to chromatin accessibility for identifying cell states. We show that scCUT\&Tag profiling of H3K27me3 distinguishes cell types in human blood and allows the generation of cell-type-specific PcG landscapes from heterogeneous tissues. Furthermore, we used scCUT\&Tag to profile H3K27me3 in a patient with a brain tumor before and after treatment, identifying cell types in the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in PcG activity in the primary sample and after treatment.},

	abstract = {Many chromatin features play critical roles in regulating gene expression. A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

Here, we describe a methylome analysis technique that enables single-cell and single-base resolution DNA methylation analysis based on reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS). The technique is highly sensitive and can detect the methylation status of up to 1.5 million CpG sites within the genome of an individual mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Moreover, we show that the technique can detect the methylation status of individual CpG sites in a haploid sperm cell in a digitized manner as either unmethylated or fully methylated. Furthermore, we show that the demethylation dynamics of maternal and paternal genomes after fertilization can be traced within the individual pronuclei of mouse zygotes. The demethylation process of the genic regions is faster than that of the intergenic regions in both male and female pronuclei. Our method paves the way for the exploration of the dynamic methylome landscapes of individual cells at single-base resolution during physiological processes such as embryonic development, or during pathological processes such as tumorigenesis.},

Using these technological advances, we studied epigenomic cell-state dynamics in three in vitro models of cellular differentiation and pluripotency, where we observed characteristic patterns of epigenome remodeling and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The described method enables single-cell analysis of DNA methylation in a broad range of biological systems, including embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer.

The rapidly emerging field of single-cell proteomics aims at complementing transcriptome and genome data by generating comparative protein expression profiles from individual cells. Recent developments demonstrated tremendous improvements in sample preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, quantifying over 1000 proteins from a single cell. Efficient and reproducible sample processing in conjunction with sensitive MS acquisition strategies will allow to further increase the proteome coverage of tissues with single-cell resolution. The required throughput and data reliability of such studies are still subject to further developments.

Although DNA and RNA sequencing-based methods have dominated the field to date, global proteome profiling has also entered the main stage. Single-cell proteomics was facilitated by advancements in different aspects of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, such as instrument design, sample preparation, chromatography and ion mobility.

Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis.},

Here, we develop Perturb-seq, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based perturbations to perform many such assays in a pool. We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.},

	abstract = {High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technique but only generates short reads from one end of a cDNA template, limiting the reconstruction of highly diverse sequences such as antigen receptors. To overcome this limitation, we combined targeted capture and long-read sequencing of T-cell-receptor (TCR) and B-cell-receptor (BCR) mRNA transcripts with short-read transcriptome profiling of barcoded single-cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We show that Repertoire and Gene Expression by Sequencing (RAGE-Seq) can generate accurate full-length antigen receptor sequences at nucleotide resolution, infer B-cell clonal evolution and identify alternatively spliced BCR transcripts. We apply RAGE-Seq to 7138 cells sampled from the primary tumor and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient to track transcriptome profiles of expanded lymphocyte clones across tissues. Our results demonstrate that RAGE-Seq is a powerful method for tracking the clonal evolution from large numbers of lymphocytes applicable to the study of immunity, autoimmunity and cancer.},

The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription.

	abstract = {Glucose homeostasis requires the tight regulation of glucose utilization by liver, muscle and white or brown fat, and glucose production and release in the blood by liver. The major goal of maintaining glycemia at ∼ 5 mM is to ensure a sufficient flux of glucose to the brain, which depends mostly on this nutrient as a source of metabolic energy. This homeostatic process is controlled by hormones, mainly glucagon and insulin, and by autonomic nervous activities that control the metabolic state of liver, muscle and fat tissue but also the secretory activity of the endocrine pancreas. Activation or inhibition of the sympathetic or parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous systems are controlled by glucose-excited or glucose-inhibited neurons located at different anatomical sites, mainly in the brainstem and the hypothalamus. Activation of these neurons by hyper- or hypoglycemia represents a critical aspect of the control of glucose homeostasis, and loss of glucose sensing by these cells as well as by pancreatic β-cells is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In this article, aspects of the brain-endocrine pancreas axis are reviewed, highlighting the importance of central glucose sensing in the control of counterregulation to hypoglycemia but also mentioning the role of the neural control in β-cell mass and function. Overall, the conclusions of these studies is that impaired glucose homeostasis, such as associated with type 2 diabetes, but also defective counterregulation to hypoglycemia, may be caused by initial defects in glucose sensing.},

Blocking FSH signaling by Fshr knock-out led to impaired glucose tolerance owing to decreased insulin secretion, while high FSH levels caused insufficient insulin secretion as well. In vitro, we found that FSH orchestrated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in a bell curve manner. Mechanistically, FSH primarily activates Gαs via FSHR, promoting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium pathways to stimulate GSIS, whereas high FSH levels could activate Gαi to inhibit the cAMP/PKA pathway and the amplified effect on GSIS.

Murine and human β-cells produce 20-HETE, and the ω-hydroxylase-mediated formation and release of 20-HETE is strongly stimulated by glucose. Pharmacological inhibition of 20-HETE formation and blockade of FFAR1 in islets inhibits GSIS. In islets from type-2 diabetic humans and mice, glucose-stimulated 20-HETE formation and 20-HETE-dependent stimulation of GSIS are strongly reduced. We show that 20-HETE is an FFAR1 agonist, which functions as an autocrine positive feed-forward regulator of GSIS, and that a reduced glucose-induced 20-HETE formation contributes to inefficient GSIS in type-2 diabetes.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12986-016-0119-5},
	abstract = {Background
Free fatty acids (FFAs) acutely stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. Conflicting results have been presented regarding this effect at non-stimulatory glucose concentration, however. The aim of our study was to investigate how long-chain FFAs affect insulin secretion from isolated human pancreatic islets in the presence of physiologically fasting glucose concentrations and to explore the contribution of mitochondria to the effects on secretion.

Methods
Insulin secretion from human pancreatic islets was measured from short-term static incubation or perfusion system at fasting glucose concentration (5.5 mM) with or without 4 different FFAs (palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, and oleate). The contribution of mitochondrial metabolism to the effects of fatty acid-stimulated insulin secretion was explored.

Results
The average increase in insulin secretion, measured from statically incubated and dynamically perifused human islets, was about 2-fold for saturated free fatty acids (SFAs) (palmitate and stearate) and 3-fold for mono-unsaturated free fatty acids (MUFAs) (palmitoleate and oleate) compared with 5.5 mmol/l glucose alone. Accordingly, MUFAs induced 50 \% and SFAs 20 \% higher levels of oxygen consumption compared with islets exposed to 5.5 mmol/l glucose alone. The effect was due to increased glycolysis. When glucose was omitted from the medium, addition of the FFAs did not affect oxygen consumption. However, the FFAs still stimulated insulin secretion from the islets although secretion was more than halved. The mitochondria-independent action was via fatty acid metabolism and FFAR1/GPR40 signaling.

Conclusions
The findings suggest that long-chain FFAs acutely induce insulin secretion from human islets at physiologically fasting glucose concentrations, with MUFAs being more potent than SFAs, and that this effect is associated with increased glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration.},

	abstract = {Fatty acid (FA)-stimulated insulin secretion (FASIS) is reviewed here in contrast to type 2 diabetes etiology, resulting from FA overload, oxidative stress, intermediate hyperinsulinemia, and inflammation, all converging into insulin resistance. Focusing on pancreatic islet β-cells, we compare the physiological FA roles with the pathological ones. Considering FAs not as mere amplifiers of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), but as parallel insulin granule exocytosis inductors, partly independent of the KATP channel closure, we describe the FA initiating roles in the prediabetic state that is induced by retardations in the glycerol-3-phosphate (glucose)-promoted glycerol/FA cycle and by the impaired GPR40/FFA1 (free FA1) receptor pathway, specifically in its amplification by the redox-activated mitochondrial phospholipase, iPLA2γ. Also, excessive dietary FAs stimulate intestine enterocyte incretin secretion, further elevating GSIS, even at low glucose levels, thus contributing to diabetic hyperinsulinemia. With overnutrition and obesity, the FA overload causes impaired GSIS by metabolic dysbalance, paralleled by oxidative and metabolic stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and numerous pro-apoptotic signaling, all leading to decreased β-cell survival. Lipotoxicity is exerted by saturated FAs, whereas ω-3 polyunsaturated FAs frequently exert antilipotoxic effects. FA-facilitated inflammation upon the recruitment of excess M1 macrophages into islets (over resolving M2 type), amplified by cytokine and chemokine secretion by β-cells, leads to an inevitable failure of pancreatic β-cells.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Deleterious effects of free fatty acids, FFAs, on insulin sensitivity are observed in vivo studies in humans. Mechanisms include impaired insulin signaling, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, but the effects on insulin secretion are less well known. Our aim was to review the relationship of increased FFAs with insulin resistance, secretion and mainly with the incretin effect in humans. Narrative review. Increased endogenous or administered FFAs induce insulin resistance. FFAs effects on insulin secretion are debatable; inhibition and stimulation have been reported, depending on the type and duration of lipids exposition and the study subjects. Chronically elevated FFAs seem to decrease insulin biosynthesis, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and β-cell glucose sensitivity. Lipids infusion decreases the response to incretins with unchanged incretin levels in volunteers with normal glucose tolerance. In contrast, FFAs reduction by acipimox did not restore the incretin effect in type-2 diabetes, probably due to the dysfunctional β-cell. Possible mechanisms of FFAs excess on incretin effect include reduction of the expression and levels of GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) receptor, reduction of connexin-36 expression thus the coordinated secretory activity in response to GLP-1, and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors downregulation in islets cells. Increased circulating FFAs impair insulin sensitivity. Effects on insulin secretion are complex and controversial. Deleterious effects on the incretin-induced potentiation of insulin secretion were reported. More investigation is needed to better understand the extent and mechanisms of β-cell impairment and insulin resistance induced by increased FFAs and how to prevent them.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic β-cells are exquisitely organised to continually monitor and respond to dietary nutrients, under the modulation of additional neurohormonal signals, in order to secrete insulin to best meet the needs of the organism. β-cell nutrient sensing requires complex mechanisms of metabolic activation, resulting in production of stimulus-secretion coupling signals that promote insulin biosynthesis and release. The primary stimulus for insulin secretion is an elevation in blood glucose concentration and β-cells are particularly responsive to this important nutrient secretagogue via the tight regulation of glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways at steps such as glucokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, glutamate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial redoxshuttles. With respect to development of type-2 diabetes (T2DM), it is important to consider individual effects of different classes of nutrient or other physiological or pharmacological agents on metabolism and insulin secretion and to also acknowledge and examine the interplay between glucose metabolism and that of the two other primary nutrient classes, amino acids (such as arginine and glutamine) and fatty acids. It is the mixed nutrient sensing and outputs of glucose, amino and fatty acid metabolism that generate the metabolic coupling factors (MCFs) essential for signalling for insulin exocytosis. Primary MCFs in the β-cell include ATP, NADPH, glutamate, long chain acyl coenzyme A and diacylglycerol. It is the failure to generate MCFs in a coordinated manner and at sufficient levels that underlies the failure of β-cell secretion during the pathogenesis of T2DM.},

	abstract = {Specific amino acids are known to acutely and chronically regulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in vivo and in vitro. Mitochondrial metabolism is crucial for the coupling of amino acid and glucose recognition to exocytosis of insulin granules. This is illustrated by in vitro and in vivo observations discussed in the present review. Mitochondria generate ATP, which is the main coupling messenger in insulin secretion, and other coupling factors, which serve as sensors for the control of the exocytotic process. Numerous studies have sought to identify the factors that mediate the key amplifying pathway over the Ca2+ signal in nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Predominantly, these factors are nucleotides (ATP, GTP, cAMP, and NADPH), although metabolites have also been proposed, such as long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives and glutamate. This scenario further highlights the importance of the key enzymes or transporters, e.g., glutamate dehydrogenase, the aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, and the malate-aspartate shuttle in the control of insulin secretion. In addition, after chronic exposure, amino acids may influence gene expression in the β-cell, which subsequently alters levels of insulin secretion. Therefore, amino acids may play a direct or indirect (via generation of putative messengers of mitochondrial origin) role in insulin secretion.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the glucose dependency of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) effects on insulin and glucagon release in 10 healthy male subjects ([means ± SEM] aged 23 ± 1 years, BMI 23 ± 1 kg/m2, and HbA1c 5.5 ± 0.1\%).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Saline or physiological doses of GIP were administered intravenously (randomized and double blinded) during 90 min of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, euglycemia, or hyperglycemia.

RESULTS
During hypoglycemia, GIP infusion caused greater glucagon responses during the first 30 min compared with saline (76 ± 17 vs. 28 ± 16 pmol/L per 30 min, P {\textless} 0.008), with similar peak levels of glucagon reached after 60 min. During euglycemia, GIP infusion elicited larger glucagon responses (62 ± 18 vs. −11 ± 8 pmol/L per 90 min, P {\textless} 0.005). During hyperglycemia, comparable suppression of plasma glucagon (−461 ± 81 vs. −371 ± 50 pmol/L per 90 min, P = 0.26) was observed with GIP and saline infusions. In addition, during hyperglycemia, GIP more than doubled the insulin secretion rate (P {\textless} 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS
In healthy subjects, GIP has no effect on glucagon responses during hyperglycemia while strongly potentiating insulin secretion. In contrast, GIP increases glucagon levels during fasting and hypoglycemic conditions, where it has little or no effect on insulin secretion. Thus, GIP seems to be a physiological bifunctional blood glucose stabilizer with diverging glucose-dependent effects on the two main pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones.},

	abstract = {Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are the two primary incretin hormones secreted from the intestine on ingestion of glucose or nutrients to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. GIP and GLP-1 exert their effects by binding to their specific receptors, the GIP receptor (GIPR) and the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family. Receptor binding activates and increases the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in pancreatic β cells, thereby stimulating insulin secretion glucose-dependently. In addition to their insulinotropic effects, GIP and GLP-1 play critical roles in various biological processes in different tissues and organs that express GIPR and GLP-1R, including the pancreas, fat, bone and the brain. Within the pancreas, GIP and GLP-1 together promote β cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, thereby expanding pancreatic β cell mass, while GIP enhances postprandial glucagon response and GLP-1 suppresses it. In adipose tissues, GIP but not GLP-1 facilitates fat deposition. In bone, GIP promotes bone formation while GLP-1 inhibits bone absorption. In the brain, both GIP and GLP-1 are thought to be involved in memory formation as well as the control of appetite. In addition to these differences, secretion of GIP and GLP-1 and their insulinotropic effects on β cells have been shown to differ in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy subjects. We summarize here the similarities and differences of these two incretin hormones in secretion and metabolism, their insulinotropic action on pancreatic β cells, and their non-insulinotropic effects, and discuss their potential in treatment of type 2 diabetes.

	abstract = {The major goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to control the hyperglycaemia characteristic of the disease. However, treatment with common therapies such as insulin or insulinotrophic sulphonylureas (SU), while effective in reducing hyperglycaemia, may impose a greater risk of hypoglycaemia, as neither therapy is self-regulated by ambient blood glucose concentrations. Hypoglycaemia has been associated with adverse physical and psychological outcomes and may contribute to negative cardiovascular events; hence minimization of hypoglycaemia risk is clinically advantageous. Stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists is known to be glucose-dependent. GLP-1R agonists potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and have little or no activity on insulin secretion in the absence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. This ‘glucose-regulated’ activity of GLP-1R agonists makes them useful and potentially safer therapeutics for overall glucose control compared to non-regulated therapies; hyperglycaemia can be reduced with minimal hypoglycaemia. While the inherent mechanism of action of GLP-1R agonists mediates their glucose dependence, studies in rats suggest that SUs may uncouple this dependence. This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies showing that the majority of events of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with GLP-1R agonists occur in patients treated with a concomitant SU. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms by which GLP-1R signalling promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells via a glucose-dependent process.},

	abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose dependent manner. Several pathways mediate this action by rapid, kinase phosphorylation-dependent, but gene expression-independent mechanisms. Since GLP-1-induced insulin secretion requires glucose metabolism, we aimed to address the hypothesis that GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signalling can modulate glucose uptake and utilization in β-cells. We have assessed various metabolic parameters after short and long exposure of clonal BRIN-BD11 β-cells and rodent islets to the GLP-1R agonist Exendin-4 (50 nM). Here we report for the first time that prolonged stimulation of the GLP-1R for 18 hours promotes metabolic reprogramming of β-cells. This is evidenced by up-regulation of glycolytic enzyme expression, increased rates of glucose uptake and consumption, as well as augmented ATP content, insulin secretion and glycolytic flux after removal of Exendin-4. In our model, depletion of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) impaired the effects of Exendin-4 on glucose metabolism, while pharmacological inhibition of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or mTOR completely abolished such effects. Considering the central role of glucose catabolism for stimulus-secretion coupling in β-cells, our findings suggest that chronic GLP-1 actions on insulin secretion include elevated β-cell glucose metabolism. Moreover, our data reveal novel aspects of GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion involving de novo gene expression.},

The therapeutic use of native GLP-1 is inadequate due to its short in vivo half-life. We recently developed a novel GLP-1 mimetics supaglutide, and demonstrated that this formulation retained native GLP-1 biological activities and possessed long-lasting GLP-1 actions. In this study, we further examined its abilities in regulating blood glucose in diabetic mice. We found that supaglutide stimulated insulin secretion in both mouse and human islets in a dose-dependent fashion. Oral glucose tolerance test conducted in normal ICR mice showed that supaglutide significantly decreased postprandial glucose excursions in a dose-dependent fashion. In type 2 diabetic db/db mice, a single-dose injection of supaglutide significantly decreased blood glucose levels, and this efficacy was lasted for at least 72 h in a dose-dependent fashion. During a 4-weeks intervention course supaglutide (twice injections per week) dose-dependently and significantly decreased fasting and random blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic db/db mice. Supaglutide, at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg, significantly reduced serum fructosamine levels. This was associated with significant enlargement of beta-cell mass, increased pancreatic insulin content, and increased plasma insulin level. Notably, during the intervention course supaglutide significantly reduced body-weight gain in these obese diabetic mice, associated with reduced fat mass (but not the lean mass), improved lipid profile, i.e., declined serum triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels compared to the placebo control. These finding reveals that supaglutide exerts beneficial effects in regulating blood glucose and lipid homeostasis in diabetic db/db mice.},

Produced in intestinal L-cells through posttranslational processing of the proglucagon gene, GLP-1 is released from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. Peripherally, GLP-1 is known to affect gut motility, inhibit gastric acid secretion, and inhibit glucagon secretion. In the central nervous system, GLP-1 induces satiety, leading to reduced weight gain. In the pancreas, GLP-1 is now known to induce expansion of insulin-secreting β-cell mass, in addition to its most well-characterized effect: the augmentation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. GLP-1 is believed to enhance insulin secretion through mechanisms involving the regulation of ion channels (including ATP-sensitive K+ channels, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, voltage-dependent K+ channels, and nonselective cation channels) and by the regulation of intracellular energy homeostasis and exocytosis.

	abstract = {Insulin clearance is a highly variable and important factor that affects circulating insulin concentrations. We developed a novel model-based method to estimate both hepatic and extrahepatic insulin clearance using plasma insulin and C-peptide profiles obtained from the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Data from 100 African immigrants without diabetes (mean age 38 years, body weight 81.7 kg, fasting plasma glucose concentration 83 mg/dL, and fasting insulin concentration 37 pmol/L) were used. Endogenous insulin secretion (calculated by C-peptide deconvolution) and insulin infusion rates were used as inputs to a new two-compartment model of insulin kinetics and hepatic and extrahepatic clearance parameters were estimated. Good agreement between modeled and measured plasma insulin profiles was observed (mean normalized root mean square error 6.8\%), and considerable intersubject variability in parameters of insulin clearance among individuals was identified (the mean [interquartile range] for hepatic extraction was 25.8\% [32.7\%], and for extrahepatic insulin clearance was 20.7 mL/kg/min [11.7 mL/kg/min]). Parameters of insulin clearance were correlated with measures of insulin sensitivity and acute insulin response to glucose. The method described appears promising for future research aimed at characterizing variability in insulin clearance and the mechanisms involved in the regulation of insulin clearance.},

On the basis of recent experimental evidence, we summarize existing evidence to suggest hepatic insulin clearance as a major and immediate regulator of systemic insulin concentrations responding within days to altered dietary energy and, in particular, carbohydrate intake. Hepatic insulin clearance seems to be closely associated with opposite alterations in hepatic lipid content and glucose production, providing a potential mechanistic link to hepatic insulin sensitivity. The molecular regulation of insulin clearance in the liver is likely to involve changes in insulin binding and receptor internalization in response to the dietary alterations, the molecular mechanisms of which await further research.},

	abstract = {Upon its secretion from pancreatic β-cells, insulin reaches the liver through the portal circulation to exert its action and eventually undergo clearance in the hepatocytes. In addition to insulin secretion, hepatic insulin clearance regulates the homeostatic level of insulin that is required to reach peripheral insulin target tissues to elicit proper insulin action. Receptor-mediated insulin uptake followed by its degradation constitutes the basic mechanism of insulin clearance. Upon its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) takes part in the insulin-insulin receptor complex to increase the rate of its endocytosis and targeting to the degradation pathways. This review summarizes how this process is regulated and how it is associated with insulin-degrading enzyme in the liver. It also discusses the physiological implications of impaired hepatic insulin clearance: Whereas reduced insulin clearance cooperates with increased insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance, it can also cause hepatic insulin resistance. Because chronic hyperinsulinemia stimulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, impaired insulin clearance also causes hepatic steatosis. Thus impaired insulin clearance can underlie the link between hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Delineating these regulatory pathways should lead to building more effective therapeutic strategies against metabolic syndrome.},

Thus, we examined insulin clearance and its possible determinants in individuals with recent-onset diabetes.Participants of the German Diabetes Study (GDS) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (n = 306), type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 489), or normal glucose tolerance (control [CON]) (n = 167) underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps for assessment of whole-body insulin sensitivity (M value) and insulin clearance (ICCLAMP). Insulin clearance rates were further calculated during intravenous glucose tolerance tests (ICIVGTT) and mixed-meal tests (ICMMT). Hepatocellular lipid content (HCL) was quantified with 1H-MRS.Both T1D and T2D groups had lower ICCLAMP (0.12 ± 0.07 and 0.21 ± 0.06 vs. 0.28 ± 0.14 arbitrary units [a.u.], respectively, all P \&lt; 0.05) and ICMMT (0.71 ± 0.35 and 0.99 ± 0.33 vs. 1.20 ± 0.36 a.u., all P \&lt; 0.05) than CON. In T1D, ICCLAMP, ICIVGTT, and ICMMT correlated negatively with HbA1c (all P \&lt; 0.05). M value correlated positively with ICIVGTT in CON and T2D (r = 0.199 and r = 0.178, P \&lt; 0.05) and with ICMMT in CON (r = 0.176, P \&lt; 0.05).

In line, T2D or CON subjects with steatosis featured lower ICMMT than those without steatosis (both P \&lt; 0.05).Insulin clearance is reduced in both T1D and T2D within the first year after diagnosis but correlates negatively with liver lipid content rather in T2D. Moreover, insulin clearance differently associates with glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in each diabetes type, which may suggest specific mechanisms affecting insulin kinetics.},

Transcriptomes of FACS-purified α-, β-, and δ-cells using bulk RNA-sequencing have facilitated our understanding of the complex network of cross talk between islet cells and its effects on β-cell function. However, these approaches were by design not intended to resolve heterogeneity between individual cells. Several recent studies used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to report considerable heterogeneity within mouse and human β-cells. In this Perspective, we assess how this newfound ability to assess gene expression at single-cell resolution has enhanced our understanding of β-cell heterogeneity. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of several single human β-cell transcriptome data sets and ask if the heterogeneity reported by these studies showed overlap and concurred with previously known examples of β-cell heterogeneity. We also illustrate the impact of the inevitable limitations of working at or below the limit of detection of gene expression at single cell resolution and their consequences for the quality of single–islet cell transcriptome data. Finally, we offer some guidance on when to opt for scRNA-Seq and when bulk sequencing approaches may be better suited.},

Identification of the mammalian membrane fatty acid transporter(s) has been the focus of active investigation by several research groups. In this review we discuss three candidate proteins: FABPm, FAT/CD36 and FATP which have been cloned and are currently being characterized.

	abstract = {Fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), a member of the FATP/Slc27 protein family, enhances the cellular uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and is expressed in several insulin-sensitive tissues. In adipocyies and skeletal muscle, FATP1 translocates from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Here we show that insulin-stimulated fatty acid uptake is completely abolished in FATP1-null adipocytes and greatly reduced in skeletal muscle of FATP1-knockout animals while basal LCFA uptake by both tissues was unaffected. Moreover, loss of FATP1 function altered regulation of postprandial serum LCFA, causing a redistribution of lipids from adipocyte tissue and muscle to the liver, and led to a complete protection from diet-induced obesity and insulin desensitization. This is the first in vivo evidence that insulin can regulate the uptake of LCFA by tissues via FATP1 activation and that FATPs determine the tissue distribution of dietary lipids. The strong protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin desensitization observed in FATP1-null animals suggests FATP1 as a novel antidiabetic target.

	abstract = {It is well known that muscle contraction and insulin can independently translocate GLUT-4 from an intracellular depot to the plasma membrane. Recently, we have shown that the fatty acid transporter FAT/CD36 is translocated from an intracellular depot to the plasma membrane by muscle contraction ({\textless}30 min) (Bonen et al. J Biol Chem 275: 14501-14508, 2000). In the present study, we examined whether insulin also induced the translocation of FAT/CD36 in rat skeletal muscle. In studies in perfused rat hindlimb muscles, we observed that insulin increased fatty acid uptake by +51\%. Insulin increased the rate of palmitate incorporation into triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and phospholipids (P {\textless} 0.05) while reducing muscle palmitate oxidation (P {\textless} 0.05). Perfusing rat hindlimb muscles with insulin increased plasma membrane FAT/CD36 by +48\% (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas concomitantly the intracellular FAT/CD36 depot was reduced by 68\% (P {\textless} 0.05). These insulin-induced effects on FAT/CD36 translocation were inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002. Thus these studies have shown for the first time that insulin can induce the translocation of FAT/CD36 from an intracellular depot to the plasma membrane. This reveals a previously unknown level of regulation of fatty acid transport by insulin and may well have important consequences in furthering our understanding of the relation between fatty acid metabolism and insulin resistance.},

Deficiencies in β-cell insulin secretion result in the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, metabolic disorders characterized by high levels of blood glucose. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by the presence of peripheral insulin resistance in tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver and develops when β-cells fail to compensate for the peripheral insulin resistance. Insulin resistance triggers a rise in insulin demand and leads to β-cell compensation by increasing both β-cell mass and insulin secretion and leads to the development of hyperinsulinemia. In a vicious cycle, hyperinsulinemia exacerbates the metabolic dysregulations that lead to β-cell failure and the development of T2DM. Insulin and IGF-1 signaling pathways play critical roles in maintaining the differentiated phenotype of β-cells. The autocrine actions of secreted insulin on β-cells is still controversial; work by us and others has shown positive and negative actions by insulin on β-cells. We discuss findings that support the concept of an autocrine action of secreted insulin on β-cells. The hypothesis of whether, during the development of T2DM, secreted insulin initially acts as a friend and contributes to β-cell compensation and then, at a later stage, becomes a foe and contributes to β-cell decompensation will be discussed.},

We ask, how convincing are these, and what are the confusing issues?

It has recently been reported that an increase in amino acid (AA) transporter expression during anabolic conditions is rapamycin-sensitive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an increase in EAA availability increases AA transporter expression in human skeletal muscle. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of seven young adult subjects (3 male, 4 female) before and 1-3 h after EAA ingestion (10 g). Blood and muscle samples were analyzed for leucine kinetics using stable isotopic techniques. Quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression, respectively, of AA transporters and members of the general AA control pathway [general control nonrepressed (GCN2), activating transcription factor (ATF4), and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2) alpha-subunit (Ser(52))]. EAA ingestion increased blood leucine concentration, delivery of leucine to muscle, transport of leucine from blood into muscle, intracellular muscle leucine concentration, ribosomal protein S6 (Ser(240/244)) phosphorylation, and muscle protein synthesis. This was followed with increased L-type AA transporter (LAT1), CD98, sodium-coupled neutral AA transporter (SNAT2), and proton-coupled amino acid transporter (PAT1) mRNA expression at 1 h (P {\textless} 0.05) and modest increases in LAT1 protein expression (3 h post-EAA) and SNAT2 protein expression (2 and 3 h post-EAA, P {\textless} 0.05). Although there were no changes in GCN2 expression and eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, ATF4 protein expression reached significance by 2 h post-EAA (P {\textless} 0.05). We conclude that an increase in EAA availability upregulates human skeletal muscle AA transporter expression, perhaps in an mTORC1-dependent manner, which may be an adaptive response necessary for improved AA intracellular delivery.},

	abstract = {The primary genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors responsible for causing insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell failure and the precise sequence of events leading to the development of type 2 diabetes are not yet fully understood. Abnormalities of triglyceride storage and lipolysis in insulin-sensitive tissues are an early manifestation of conditions characterized by insulin resistance and are detectable before the development of postprandial or fasting hyperglycemia. Increased free fatty acid (FFA) flux from adipose tissue to nonadipose tissue, resulting from abnormalities of fat metabolism, participates in and amplifies many of the fundamental metabolic derangements that are characteristic of the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes. It is also likely to play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and conversion to frank type 2 diabetes in insulin resistant individuals. Adverse metabolic consequences of increased FFA flux, to be discussed in this review, are extremely wide ranging and include, but are not limited to: 1) dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis, 2) impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver, 3) diminished insulin clearance, aggravating peripheral tissue hyperinsulinemia, and 4) impaired pancreatic beta-cell function. The precise biochemical mechanisms whereby fatty acids and cytosolic triglycerides exert their effects remain poorly understood. Recent studies, however, suggest that the sequence of events may be the following: in states of positive net energy balance, triglyceride accumulation in "fat-buffering" adipose tissue is limited by the development of adipose tissue insulin resistance. This results in diversion of energy substrates to nonadipose tissue, which in turn leads to a complex array of metabolic abnormalities characteristic of insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the biochemical mechanisms whereby glucose and fat exert adverse effects in insulin-sensitive and insulin-producing tissues are shared, thus implicating a diabetogenic role for energy excess as a whole. Although there is now evidence that weight loss through reduction of caloric intake and increase in physical activity can prevent the development of diabetes, it remains an open question as to whether specific modulation of fat metabolism will result in improvement in some or all of the above metabolic derangements or will prevent progression from insulin resistance syndrome to type 2 diabetes.},

While de novo synthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerol occurs mostly in liver, adipose tissue is the primary site for triacylglycerol storage. Insulin signalling mechanisms in adipose tissue that stimulate hydrolysis of circulating triacylglycerol, uptake of the released fatty acids and their conversion to triacylglycerol are poorly understood. New findings include (1) activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase to stimulate upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1/USF2 heterodimers, enhancing the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c); (2) stimulation of fatty acid synthase through AMP kinase modulation; (3) mobilisation of lipid droplet proteins to promote retention of triacylglycerol; and (4) upregulation of a novel carbohydrate response element binding protein β isoform that potently stimulates transcription of lipogenic enzymes. Additionally, insulin signalling through mammalian target of rapamycin to activate transcription and processing of SREBP1c described in liver may apply to adipose tissue. Paradoxically, insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes is associated with increased triacylglycerol synthesis in liver, while it is decreased in adipose tissue. This and other mysteries about insulin signalling and insulin resistance in adipose tissue make this topic especially fertile for future research.},

	doi = {10.1210/jc.2005-0960},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although insulin resistance is well established in hyperthyroidism, information on the effects of insulin on adipose tissue (AD) is limited.
METHODS: To investigate this, a meal was given to 12 hyperthyroid (HR) and 10 euthyroid (EU) subjects. Blood was withdrawn for 360 min from veins draining the anterior abdominal sc AD and from the radial artery. Blood flow was measured with 133Xe. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was calculated as triglyceride flux across AD, and AD-lipolysis was calculated as glycerol flux minus LPL.
RESULTS: Both groups displayed comparable postprandial glucose levels, with the HR having higher insulin levels than the EU. In AD of HR vs. EU: 1) blood flow was increased [area under curve 0-360 min (milliliters per 100 milliliters of tissue); 1746 +/- 208 vs. 1344 +/- 102, P = 0.001], but glucose uptake was normal [area under curve 0-360 min (micromoles per 100 milliliters of tissue); 501 +/- 114 vs. 368 +/- 48]; 2) fasting rates of lipolysis (nanomoles per minute per 100 milliliters of tissue; 329 +/- 75 vs. 89 +/- 22, P = 0.02) and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) release (nanomoles per minute per 100 milliliters of tissue; 841 +/- 146 vs. 316 +/- 97, P = 0.01), and plasma NEFA levels (micromoles per liter; 623 +/- 50 vs. 454 +/- 57, P = 0.03) were increased, but were all rapidly suppressed to levels similar to those in EU after the increase in plasma insulin levels after the meal; and 3) LPL was not stimulated by insulin.
CONCLUSIONS: In hyperthyroidism, AD lipolysis and glucose uptake are resistant to insulin. The defect in lipolysis is manifested in the fasting state, whereas postprandially this rate is rapidly suppressed to normal. This may relieve tissues from the burden of NEFAs after the meal, thus facilitating muscle glucose disposal by insulin.},

The effectiveness of insulin diminished as the concentration of these agonists increased, but insulin was able to suppress by 40\% the stimulation by a maximally effective concentration of epinephrine (1 muM). The response to glucagon, epinephrine, or insulin was not dependent upon protein synthesis as cycloheximide did not alter their effects. Insulin also suppressed the stimulation by isoproterenol of cyclic GMP. These data are the first demonstration of insulin antagonism to the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by catecholamines. Insulin reduced cyclic AMP levels which had been elevated by low concentrations of glucagon or by 1 muM epinephrine. This supports the hypothesis that the action of insulin to inhibit gluconeogenesis is mediated by the lowering of cyclic AMP levels. However, evidence is presented which indicates that insulin is able to suppress the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon or epinephrine under conditions where either the agonists or insulin had no measurable effect on cyclic AMP levels. Insulin reduced the glucagon stimulation of gluconeogenesis whether or not extracellular Ca2+ were present, even though insulin only lowered cyclic AMP levels in their presence. Insulin also reduced the stimulation by epinephrine plus propranolol where no significant changes in cyclic AMP were observed without or with insulin. In addition, insulin suppressed gluconeogenesis in cells that had been preincubated with epinephrine for 20 min, even though the cyclic AMP levels had returned to near basal values and were unaffected by insulin. Thus insulin may not need to lower cyclic AMP levels in order to suppress gluconeogenesis.},

	abstract = {Insulin inhibits glucose production through both direct and indirect effects on the liver; however, considerable controversy exists regarding the relative importance of these effects. The first aim of this study was to determine which of these processes dominates the acute control of hepatic glucose production (HGP). Somatostatin and portal vein infusions of insulin and glucagon were used to clamp the pancreatic hormones at basal levels in the nondiabetic dog. After a basal sampling period, insulin infusion was switched from the portal vein to a peripheral vein. As a result, the arterial insulin level doubled and the hepatic sinusoidal insulin level was reduced by half. While the arterial plasma FFA level and net hepatic FFA uptake fell by 40-50\%, net hepatic glucose output increased more than 2-fold and remained elevated compared with that in the control group. The second aim of this study was to determine the effect of a 4-fold rise in head insulin on HGP during peripheral hyperinsulinemia and hepatic insulin deficiency. Sensitivity of the liver was not enhanced by increased insulin delivery to the head. Thus, this study demonstrates that the direct effects of insulin dominate the acute regulation of HGP in the normal dog.},

The contribution of glycolysis decreased and that of muscle glycogen synthesis increased as the insulin levels rose. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal was decreased by 20-30\% throughout the insulin dose-response curve in diabetics compared with controls. While at low insulin infusions (2 and 3 mU/kg.min) reductions in both the glycolytic and glycogenic fluxes contributed to the defective tissue glucose uptake in diabetic rats, at the three higher insulin doses the impairment in muscle glycogen repletion accounted for all of the difference between diabetic and control rats. The muscle G-6-P concentration was decreased (208 +/- 11 vs. 267 +/- 18 nmol/g wet wt; P less than 0.01) compared with saline at the lower insulin infusion, but was gradually increased twofold (530 +/- 16; P less than 0.01 vs. basal) as the insulin concentration rose. The G-6-P concentration in diabetic rats was similar to control despite the reduction in glucose uptake. These data suggest that (a) glucose transport is the major determinant of glucose disposal at low insulin concentration, while the rate-limiting step shifts to an intracellular site at high physiological insulin concentration; and (b) prolonged moderate hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia determine two distinct cellular defects in skeletal muscle at the levels of glucose transport/phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis.},

	abstract = {Insulin is an anabolic peptide hormone secreted by the b cells of the pancreas acting through a receptor located in the membrane of target cells - major ones being liver (where it promotes glucose storage into glycogen and decreases glucose output), as well as skeletal muscle and fat (where it stimulates glucose transport through translocation of GLUT4), but also b cells, brain cells and in fact most cells, where it has pleiotropic effects. The receptor belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily and has orthologues in all metazoans. The structure of the unbound extracellular domain ("apo-receptor") has been solved. Insulin binds to two distinct sites on each a subunit of the receptor, crosslinking the two receptor halves to create high affinity. The structure of the site 1 interface has also been solved, as well as the structure of the inactive and activated tyrosine kinase, revealing the activation by phosphorylation of an autoinhibitory loop. The receptor activates a complex intracellular signaling network through IRS proteins and the canonical PI3K and ERK cascades. Overall and tissue-specific targeted gene disruption in mice has explored the role of many of the signaling proteins in creating the type 2 diabetes phenotype, with some surprising results. Insulin signaling in the liver and b cell is emerging as the major determinant in preventing type 2 diabetes, through the integrative role of molecules like IRS2 and FOXO, preventing b cell dedifferentiation. The emerging new biology of diabetes opens novel therapeutic opportunities for the 442 million type 2 diabetics worldwide.

Defects in glucose uptake represent an early step in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.GLUT4 is distributed between the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes and small heterogeneous vesicles that consist of sorting intermediates of the endosomal system and GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs). Treatment of muscle or adipose cells with insulin stimulates exocytosis of GLUT4 from multiple intracellular compartments, which results in increased GLUT4 levels at the plasma membrane for shuttling of glucose into the cell.In the absence of insulin, at least 50\% of GLUT4 is sequestered in specialized immobile GSVs. Stimulation with insulin results in regulated exocytosis of GSVs.GSV mobilization, targeting and fusion at the plasma membrane requires coordinated control of the trafficking machinery by insulin. Trafficking proteins that are regulated by insulin include multiple small GTPases of the RAB, RAL and RHO families, molecular motor proteins, the exocyst complex and SNARE regulatory proteins.Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) studies performed in live adipocytes have helped to elucidate the mechanisms by which insulin regulates specific trafficking proteins during GLUT4 exocytosis.},

	abstract = {The 1921 discovery of insulin was a Big Bang from which a vast and expanding universe of research into insulin action and resistance has issued. In the intervening century, some discoveries have matured, coalescing into solid and fertile ground for clinical application; others remain incompletely investigated and scientifically controversial. Here, we attempt to synthesize this work to guide further mechanistic investigation and to inform the development of novel therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D). The rational development of such therapies necessitates detailed knowledge of one of the key pathophysiological processes involved in T2D: insulin resistance. Understanding insulin resistance, in turn, requires knowledge of normal insulin action. In this review, both the physiology of insulin action and the pathophysiology of insulin resistance are described, focusing on three key insulin target tissues: skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue. We aim to develop an integrated physiological perspective, placing the intricate signaling effectors that carry out the cell-autonomous response to insulin in the context of the tissue-specific functions that generate the coordinated organismal response. First, in section II, the effectors and effects of direct, cell-autonomous insulin action in muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue are reviewed, beginning at the insulin receptor and working downstream. Section III considers the critical and underappreciated role of tissue crosstalk in whole body insulin action, especially the essential interaction between adipose lipolysis and hepatic gluconeogenesis. The pathophysiology of insulin resistance is then described in section IV. Special attention is given to which signaling pathways and functions become insulin resistant in the setting of chronic overnutrition, and an alternative explanation for the phenomenon of ‟selective hepatic insulin resistanceˮ is presented. Sections V, VI, and VII critically examine the evidence for and against several putative mediators of insulin resistance. Section V reviews work linking the bioactive lipids diacylglycerol, ceramide, and acylcarnitine to insulin resistance; section VI considers the impact of nutrient stresses in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria on insulin resistance; and section VII discusses non-cell autonomous factors proposed to induce insulin resistance, including inflammatory mediators, branched-chain amino acids, adipokines, and hepatokines. Finally, in section VIII, we propose an integrated model of insulin resistance that links these mediators to final common pathways of metabolite-driven gluconeogenesis and ectopic lipid accumulation.},

One way to improve classification is to study whether LADA shares genetic features with type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—To accomplish this, we studied whether LADA shares variation in the HLA locus or INS VNTR and PTPN22 genes with type 1 diabetes or the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes in 361 LADA, 718 type 1 diabetic, and 1,676 type 2 diabetic patients, as well as 1,704 healthy control subjects from Sweden and Finland.RESULTS—LADA subjects showed, compared with type 2 diabetic patients, increased frequency of risk for the HLA-DQB1 *0201/*0302 genotype (27 vs. 6.9\%; P \&lt; 1 × 10−6), with similar frequency as with type 1 diabetes (36\%). In addition, LADA subjects showed higher frequencies of protective HLA-DQB1 *0602(3)/X than type 1 diabetic patients (8.1 vs. 3.2\%, P = 0.003). The AA genotype of rs689, referring to the class I allele in the INS VNTR, as well as the CT/TT genotypes of rs2476601 in the PTPN22 gene, were increased both in type 1 diabetic (P = 3 × 10−14 and P = 1 × 10−10, respectively) and LADA (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002) subjects compared with control subjects. Notably, the frequency of the type 2 diabetes–associated CT/TT genotypes of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 were increased in LADA subjects (52.8\%; P = 0.03), to the same extent as in type 2 diabetic subjects (54.1\%, P = 3 × 10−7), compared with control subjects (44.8\%) and type 1 diabetic subjects (43.3\%).CONCLUSIONS—LADA shares genetic features with both type 1 (HLA, INS VNTR, and PTPN22) and type 2 (TCF7L2) diabetes, which justifies considering LADA as an admixture of the two major types of diabetes.},

We studied differences between patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 2 diabetes, and classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after age 35 years.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1, INS, PTPN22, and CTLA4 were genotyped in patients with LADA (n = 213), type 1 diabetes diagnosed at {\textgreater}35 years of age (T1D{\textgreater}35y; n = 257) or {\textless}20 years of age (T1D{\textless}20y; n = 158), and type 2 diabetes.

RESULTS
Although patients with LADA had an increased frequency of HLA-DQB1 and PTPN22 risk genotypes and alleles compared with type 2 diabetic subjects, the frequency was significantly lower compared with T1D{\textgreater}35y patients. Genotype frequencies, measures of insulin secretion, and metabolic traits within LADA differed according to GAD antibody (GADA) quartiles, but even the highest quartile differed from type 1 diabetes. Having two or more risk genotypes was associated with lower C-peptide concentrations in LADA.

CONCLUSIONS
LADA patients differed genetically and phenotypically from both T1D{\textgreater}35y and type 2 diabetic patients in a manner dependent on GADA levels.},

LADA – latent autoimmune diabetes in adults – is a common, hybrid form of diabetes with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiological and etiological overlap and differences between LADA and type 2 diabetes, discuss similarities between LADA and type 1 diabetes and point at future research needs. Studies conducted to date show a clear genetic overlap between LADA and type 1 diabetes with a high risk conferred by variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. In contrast, data from the limited number of studies on lifestyle factors available indicate that LADA may share several environmental risk factors with type 2 diabetes including overweight, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption (protective) and smoking. These factors are known to influence insulin sensitivity, suggesting that insulin resistance, in addition to insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of the beta cells, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of LADA. Moreover, this implies that onset of LADA, similar to type 2 diabetes, to some extent could be prevented or postponed by lifestyle modification such as weight reduction and increased physical activity. The preventive potential of LADA is an important topic to elucidate in future studies, preferably intervention studies.},

	abstract = {While there are various kinds of drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus at present, in this review article, we focus on metformin which is an insulin sensitizer and is often used as a first-choice drug worldwide. Metformin mainly activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver which leads to suppression of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Metformin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle as well, which increases translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane and thereby increases glucose uptake. Further, metformin suppresses glucagon signaling in the liver by suppressing adenylate cyclase which leads to suppression of gluconeogenesis. In addition, metformin reduces autophagy failure observed in pancreatic β-cells under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, it is known that metformin alters the gut microbiome and facilitates the transport of glucose from the circulation into excrement. It is also known that metformin reduces food intake and lowers body weight by increasing circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Furthermore, much attention has been drawn to the fact that the frequency of various cancers is lower in subjects taking metformin. Metformin suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by activating AMPK in pre-neoplastic cells, which leads to suppression of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis in pre-neoplastic cells. It has been shown recently that metformin consumption potentially influences the mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). Taken together, metformin is an old drug, but multifaceted mechanisms of action of metformin have been unraveled one after another in its long history.},

	abstract = {Currently, metformin is the first-line medication to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in most guidelines and is used daily by {\textgreater}200 million patients. Surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are complex and are still not fully understood. Early evidence highlighted the liver as the major organ involved in the effect of metformin on reducing blood levels of glucose. However, increasing evidence points towards other sites of action that might also have an important role, including the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbial communities and the tissue-resident immune cells. At the molecular level, it seems that the mechanisms of action vary depending on the dose of metformin used and duration of treatment. Initial studies have shown that metformin targets hepatic mitochondria; however, the identification of a novel target at low concentrations of metformin at the lysosome surface might reveal a new mechanism of action. Based on the efficacy and safety records in T2DM, attention has been given to the repurposing of metformin as part of adjunct therapy for the treatment of cancer, age-related diseases, inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of metformin and discuss potential emerging novel therapeutic uses.},

Despite the availability of many antidiabetes agents and pharmacotherapies targeting cardiovascular risk factors, the morbidity, mortality and economic consequences of T2DM are still a great burden to patients, society, health care systems and the economy. The need for new therapies for glycaemic control is compounded by the fact that existing treatments have limitations either because of their side effects (particularly weight gain and hypoglycaemia) or contraindications that limit their use. Furthermore, none of the current therapies have a significant impact on disease progression. Incretin-based therapies offer a new therapeutic approach to the management of T2DM, and there are also several even newer therapies in development. There are two groups of incretin-based therapies currently available; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues/mimetics. The former are given orally while the latter subcutaneously. These drugs result in glucose-dependent insulin secretion and glucose-dependent glucagon suppression, with consequent low risk of hypoglycaemia when used as mono- or combination therapy (except when used with sulphonylureas). In addition, they are either weight neutral in the case of DPP-4 inhibitors or cause weight loss in the case of incretin mimetics/analogues. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that these agents prolong beta cell survival which offers the theoretical possibility of slowing the progression to T2DM. In this article we will review the currently available antidiabetes agents with particular emphasis on incretin-based and future therapies. In addition, we will review and discuss the evidence relating to glycaemic control and cardiovascular disease.},

Defects in the function and mass of β-cells play a significant role in the development and progression of diabetes. Increased β-cell deficiency and β-cell apoptosis are observed in the pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes. At an early stage, β-cells adapt to insulin resistance, and their insulin secretion increases, but they eventually become exhausted, and the β-cell mass decreases. Various causal factors, such as high glucose, free fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, and islet amyloid polypeptides, contribute to the impairment of β-cell function. Therefore, the maintenance of β-cell function is a logical approach for the treatment and prevention of diabetes. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of these risk factors in pancreatic β-cell loss and the associated mechanisms. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic β-cell loss will provide an opportunity to identify novel therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {We review evidence that increased tissue levels of fatty acyl CoA cause the beta-cell abnormalities of nondiabetic obesity and ultimately result in obesity-dependent diabetes. Nondiabetic obesity in Zucker rats is characterized by hypersecretion of insulin at normal fasting and subfasting glucose concentrations. This is a result of beta-cell hyperplasia and increased low Km glucose usage and oxidation. These abnormalities, the hyperinsulinemia, the hyperplasia of beta-cells, i.e., its in vitro equivalent, enhanced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and the increased low Km glucose usage can be induced by culturing normal islets with 2 mmol/l free fatty acids (FFAs). Once obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats become diabetic, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is absent and beta-cell GLUT2 reduced. Islet triglyceride (TG) content is increased 10-fold, probably reflecting increased FFA delivery (plasma FFA levels {\textgreater} 1.5 mmol/l) beginning about 2 weeks before the onset of diabetes. These beta-cell abnormalities, GSIS loss, GLUT2 loss, and TG accumulation, are prevented by reducing plasma FFAs by caloric restriction and by nicotinamide injection. The loss of GSIS and the accumulation of TGs, but not the GLUT2 loss, can be induced in vitro in normal islets cultured in a 2 mmol/l FFA-containing medium, but prediabetic islets seem far more vulnerable to FFA-induced functional impairment and TG accumulation. It is proposed that in uncomplicated obesity, increased lipid availability (FFA levels {\textless} 1.5 mmol/l) induces both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in parallel fashion, thereby maintaining normoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The molecular basis of this common syndrome, however, is poorly understood. It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals. To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha. The absence of TNF-alpha resulted in significantly improved insulin sensitivity in both diet-induced obesity and that resulting for the ob/ob model of obesity. The TNFalpha-deficient obese mice had lower levels of circulating free fatty acids, and were protected from the obesity-related reduction in the insulin receptor signalling in muscle and fat tissues. These results indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin action.},

Furthermore, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet were reduced extensively in MCP-1 homozygous KO mice compared with WT animals. Finally, acute expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MCP-1 ameliorated insulin resistance in db/db mice and in WT mice fed a high-fat diet.

Clinical studies on prediction and prevention of diabetes-associated complications have demonstrated the importance of early treatment and glucose control for reducing the risk of developing diabetic complications. Transplantation of primary islets offers an effective approach for treating patients with T1D. However, this strategy is hampered by challenges such as the limited availability of islets, extensive death of islet cells, and poor vascular engraftment of islets post-transplantation.

	abstract = {Transient (TNDM) and Permanent (PNDM) Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus are rare conditions occurring in 1:300,000–400,000 live births. TNDM infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life but go into remission in a few months, with possible relapse to a permanent diabetes state usually around adolescence or as adults. The pancreatic dysfunction in this condition may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period and does not go into remission. Patients with TNDM are more likely to have intrauterine growth retardation and less likely to develop ketoacidosis than patients with PNDM. In TNDM, patients are younger at the diagnosis of diabetes and have lower initial insulin requirements. Considerable overlap occurs between the two groups, so that TNDM cannot be distinguished from PNDM based on clinical features. Very early onset diabetes mellitus seems to be unrelated to autoimmunity in most instances. A number of conditions are associated with PNDM, some of which have been elucidated at the molecular level. Among these, the very recently elucidated mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunit of the pancreatic KATP channel involved in regulation of insulin secretion, account for one third to half of the PNDM cases. Molecular analysis of chromosome 6 anomalies (found in more than 60\% in TNDM), and the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1, provides a tool to identify TNDM from PNDM in the neonatal period. This analysis also has potentially important therapeutic consequences leading to transfer some patients, those with mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas. Recurrent diabetes is common in patients with "transient" neonatal diabetes mellitus and, consequently, prolonged follow-up is imperative. Realizing how difficult it is to take care of a child of this age with diabetes mellitus should prompt clinicians to transfer these children to specialized centers. Insulin therapy and high caloric intake are the basis of the treatment. Insulin pump may offer an interesting therapeutic tool in this age group in experienced hands.},

The new definition of NDM recently adopted, that includes patients with diabetes onset within 6 months of age, has prompted studies that have set the incidence of the permanent form alone between 1:210,000 and 1:260,000 live births. Aim of the present work was to ascertain the incidence of NDM (i.e. permanent + transient form) in Italy for years 2005-2010. Patients referred to the Italian reference laboratory for NDM between years 2005 and 2010 and screened for mutations in common NDM genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS) and for uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (UDP6) were reviewed. A questionnaire aimed at identifying NDM cases investigated in other laboratories was sent to 54 Italian reference centers for pediatric diabetes. Twenty-seven patients with NDM born between 2005 and 2010 were referred to the reference laboratory. In this group, a mutation of either KCNJ11, ABCC8 or INS was found in 18 patients, and a case with UDP6 was identified. Questionnaires revealed 4 additional cases with transient neonatal diabetes due to UDP6. Incidence of NDM was calculated at 1:90,000 (CI: 1:63,000-1:132,000) live births. Thus, with the definition currently in use, about 6 new cases with NDM are expected to be born in Italy each year.},

The parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves innervate the pancreatic islet, but the precise innervation patterns are not known, particularly in human islets. Here we demonstrate that the innervation of human islets is different from that of mouse islets and that it does not conform to existing models of autonomic control of islet function. By visualizing axons in three dimensions and quantifying axonal densities and contacts within pancreatic islets, we found that, in contrast to mouse endocrine cells, human endocrine cells are sparsely contacted by autonomic axons. Few parasympathetic cholinergic axons penetrate the human islet and the invading sympathetic fibers preferentially innervate smooth muscle cells of blood vessels located within the islet. Thus, rather than modulating endocrine cell function directly, sympathetic nerves may regulate hormone secretion in human islets by controlling local blood flow or by acting on islet regions located downstream.},

	abstract = {The cytoarchitecture of human islets has been examined, focusing on cellular associations that provide the anatomical framework for paracrine interactions. By using confocal microscopy and multiple immunofluorescence, we found that, contrary to descriptions of prototypical islets in textbooks and in the literature, human islets did not show anatomical subdivisions. Insulin-immunoreactive β cells, glucagon-immunoreactive α cells, and somatostatin-containing δ cells were found scattered throughout the human islet. Human β cells were not clustered, and most (71\%) showed associations with other endocrine cells, suggesting unique paracrine interactions in human islets. Human islets contained proportionally fewer β cells and more α cells than did mouse islets. In human islets, most β, α, and δ cells were aligned along blood vessels with no particular order or arrangement, indicating that islet microcirculation likely does not determine the order of paracrine interactions. We further investigated whether the unique human islet cytoarchitecture had functional implications. Applying imaging of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, we found that β cell oscillatory activity was not coordinated throughout the human islet as it was in mouse islets. Furthermore, human islets responded with an increase in [Ca2+]i when lowering the glucose concentration to 1 mM, which can be attributed to the large contribution of α cells to the islet composition. We conclude that the unique cellular arrangement of human islets has functional implications for islet cell function.},

	abstract = {Earlier experiments with the microsphere technique suggested that a heightened serum glucose concentration consistently leads to an increase in islet blood flow (IBF). Several lines of evidence suggest that this glucose-sensitive control mechanism is located at an extrapancreatic site. The purpose of this study was to define the possible role of the central nervous system in such a mechanism. D-glucose, L-glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, or saline were therefore infused into the carotid artery, each at a dose of 1 mg X kg body wt-1 X min-1 for 3 min, and the pancreatic and islet blood flows were measured. None of these substances affected the systemic serum glucose level. The intracarotid infusion of D-glucose, however, caused a rapid increase in both the serum insulin concentration and IBF. The blood flow to the whole pancreas nevertheless remained unchanged, indicating a redistribution of flow within the gland. Carotid infusion of the other test substances or a similar amount of D-glucose given in a femoral vein did not affect these parameters. Both the increase in serum insulin concentration and the increase in IBF caused by D-glucose could be abolished by vagotomy or administration of atropine. When the systemic blood glucose concentration was increased by intraperitoneal glucose administration (2 g/kg body wt), vagotomy blocked the increase in islet blood flow but not the concomitant insulin release. These observations suggest that the glucose-induced increase in IBF is mediated by vagal cholinergic influences.},

Impaired insulin secretion results in the chronic hyperglycemia that characterizes type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which currently afflicts {\textgreater}450 million people worldwide. The healthy β-cell acts as a glucose sensor matching its output to the circulating glucose concentration. It does so via metabolically induced changes in electrical activity, which culminate in an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and initiation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the β-cell transcriptome, electrical activity, and insulin exocytosis. We highlight salient differences between mouse and human β-cells, provide models of how the different ion channels contribute to their electrical activity and insulin secretion, and conclude by discussing how these processes become perturbed in T2DM.},

Cells obtained by mechanical dispersion of isolated rat islets of Langerhans were mixed with protein A-coated sheep red blood cells and incubated in the presence of an anti-insulin serum, under conditions known to affect insulin release. The cell mixture was further incubated with complement and finally fixed. Insulin release was revealed by the presence of hemolytic plaques which resulted from the complement-mediated lysis of red blood cells bearing insulin-anti-insulin complexes bound to protein A. Quantitation of hemolytic plaques around trypan blue-unstained and immunohistochemically identified B cells showed that stimulation of insulin release results in the recruitment of increasing numbers of secreting B cells as well as in the enhanced response of individual B cells. Reverse changes occur upon inhibition of insulin release. Comparison of freshly dispersed and one-day-cultured preparations did not reveal significant differences in the secretory response of undamaged B cells. In both preparations, single B cells responded to secretagogues in smaller proportions and to a lesser extent than clusters in which B cells had either maintained or restored contacts and junctional communication with their neighbours. However, the overall preponderant response of clusters was less than expected from the number of individually secreting B cells they contained. The data show that B cells are heterogeneous in terms of their ability to release insulin and provide evidence that cell-to-cell adhesion and/or junctional communication regulate hormone secretion from individual B cells.},

Here we show that subtle differences in β-cell maturity, defined using PDX1 and MAFA expression, contribute to islet operation. Functional mapping of rodent and human islets containing proportionally more PDX1HIGH and MAFAHIGH β-cells reveals defects in metabolism, ionic fluxes and insulin secretion. At the transcriptomic level, the presence of increased numbers of PDX1HIGH and MAFAHIGH β-cells leads to dysregulation of gene pathways involved in metabolic processes. Using a chemogenetic disruption strategy, differences in PDX1 and MAFA expression are shown to depend on islet Ca2+ signaling patterns. During metabolic stress, islet function can be restored by redressing the balance between PDX1 and MAFA levels across the β-cell population. Thus, preserving heterogeneity in PDX1 and MAFA expression, and more widely in β-cell maturity, might be important for the maintenance of islet function., Beta cell subpopulations with low expression in PDX1, MAFA, and insulin might contribute to islet function and insulin release.

	abstract = {Background
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in failure of blood glucose regulation and devastating secondary complications. Thus, β-cells are currently the prime target for cell-replacement and regenerative therapy. Triggering endogenous repair is a promising strategy to restore β-cell mass and normoglycemia in diabetic patients. Potential strategies include targeting specific β-cell subpopulations to increase proliferation or maturation. Alternatively, transdifferentiation of pancreatic islet cells (e.g. α- or δ-cells), extra-islet cells (acinar and ductal cells), hepatocytes, or intestinal cells into insulin-producing cells might improve glycemic control. To this end, it is crucial to systematically characterize and unravel the transcriptional program of all pancreatic cell types at the molecular level in homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, it is necessary to better determine the underlying mechanisms of β-cell maturation, maintenance, and dysfunction in diabetes, to identify and molecularly profile endocrine subpopulations with regenerative potential, and to translate the findings from mice to man. Recent approaches in single-cell biology started to illuminate heterogeneity and plasticity in the pancreas that might be targeted for β-cell regeneration in diabetic patients.

Scope of review
This review discusses recent literature on single-cell analysis including single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell mass cytometry, and flow cytometry of pancreatic cell types in the context of mechanisms of endogenous β-cell regeneration. We discuss new findings on the regulation of postnatal β-cell proliferation and maturation. We highlight how single-cell analysis recapitulates described principles of functional β-cell heterogeneity in animal models and adds new knowledge on the extent of β-cell heterogeneity in humans as well as its role in homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, we summarize the findings on cell subpopulations with regenerative potential that might enable the formation of new β-cells in diseased state. Finally, we review new data on the transcriptional program and function of rare pancreatic cell types and their implication in diabetes.

Major conclusion
Novel, single-cell technologies offer high molecular resolution of cellular heterogeneity within the pancreas and provide information on processes and factors that govern β-cell homeostasis, proliferation, and maturation. Eventually, these technologies might lead to the characterization of cells with regenerative potential and unravel disease-associated changes in gene expression to identify cellular and molecular targets for therapy.},

Emerging data within the field of pancreas biology are revising current beliefs about how cellular identity is shaped by developmental and environmental cues under homeostasis and stress conditions. Here, we discuss the changes occurring in cellular states upon fate modulation and address how our understanding of the nature of this fluidity is shaping therapeutic approaches to pancreatic disorders such as diabetes and cancer.},

The importance of genetic, intrauterine, and environmental factors in the determination of “susceptible” islets and overall risk for T2D is reviewed. The likely mechanisms of β cell failure are discussed within the two broad categories: those with initiation and those with progression roles.},

	abstract = {This article proposes five stages in the progression of diabetes, each of which is characterized by different changes in β-cell mass, phenotype, and function. Stage 1 is compensation: insulin secretion increases to maintain normoglycemia in the face of insulin resistance and/or decreasing β-cell mass. This stage is characterized by maintenance of differentiated function with intact acute glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Stage 2 occurs when glucose levels start to rise, reaching ∼5.0–6.5 mmol/l; this is a stable state of β-cell adaptation with loss of β-cell mass and disruption of function as evidenced by diminished GSIS and β-cell dedifferentiation. Stage 3 is a transient unstable period of early decompensation in which glucose levels rise relatively rapidly to the frank diabetes of stage 4, which is characterized as stable decompensation with more severe β-cell dedifferentiation. Finally, stage 5 is characterized by severe decompensation representing a profound reduction in β-cell mass with progression to ketosis. Movement across stages 1–4 can be in either direction. For example, individuals with treated type 2 diabetes can move from stage 4 to stage 1 or stage 2. For type 1 diabetes, as remission develops, progression from stage 4 to stage 2 is typically found. Delineation of these stages provides insight into the pathophysiology of both progression and remission of diabetes.},

The method utilizes a flow cytometric detection of the rapid variations in endogenous NAD (P) H - and FAD - fluorescence after exposure to 20 mM glucose. Under these conditions, a two-fold increase in NAD (P) H and a 40\% decrease in FAD was observed in more than 75\% of B-cells isolated from fed normal rats. The technique makes it possible to study the metabolic behaviour of the B-cell population in (physio)pathological conditions of impaired glucose-induced insulin release; the availability of functionally homogenous B-cell preparations facilitates studies on stimulus-secretion coupling. In view of the universal role of the cellular metabolic redox state in cell regulation, it is suggested that similar techniques can be developed for the metabolic analysis of other cell types and for their purification according to their responsiveness to specific stimuli.},

In this study, we addressed the potential contribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in pancreatic β cell development and maturation. We show that NPY expression is restricted from the progenitor populations during pancreatic development and marks functionally immature β cells in fetal and neonatal mice and humans. NPY expression is epigenetically downregulated in β cells upon maturation. Neonatal β cells that express NPY are more replicative, and knockdown of NPY expression in neonatal mouse islets reduces replication and enhances insulin secretion in response to high glucose. These data show that NPY expression likely promotes replication and contributes to impaired glucose responsiveness in neonatal β cells. We show that NPY expression reemerges in β cells in mice fed with high-fat diet as well as in diabetes in mice and humans, establishing a potential new mechanism to explain impaired β cell maturity in diabetes. Together, these studies highlight the contribution of NPY in the regulation of β cell differentiation and have potential applications for β cell supplementation for diabetes therapy.},

Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4), a non-Ca2+ binding paralog of the β cell Ca2+ sensor Syt7, increased by ∼8-fold during β cell maturation. Syt4 ablation increased basal insulin secretion and compromised GSIS. Precocious Syt4 expression repressed basal insulin secretion but also impaired islet morphogenesis and GSIS. Syt4 was localized on insulin granules and Syt4 levels inversely related to the number of readily releasable vesicles. Thus, transcriptional regulation of Syt4 affects insulin secretion; Syt4 expression is regulated in part by\&nbsp;Myt transcription factors, which repress Syt4 transcription. Finally, human SYT4 regulated GSIS in EndoC-βH1 cells, a human β cell line. These findings reveal the role that altered Ca2+ sensing plays in regulating β cell maturation.},

We have examined the effect of young age on compensatory proliferation of pancreatic β cells in vivo. Surprisingly, β cells in suckling mice fail to enter the cell division cycle in response to a diabetogenic injury or increased glycolysis. The potential of β cells for compensatory proliferation is acquired following premature weaning to normal chow, but not to a diet mimicking maternal milk. In addition, weaning coincides with enhanced glucose-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation and insulin secretion from islets. Transcriptome analysis reveals that weaning increases the expression of genes involved in replication licensing, suggesting a mechanism for increased responsiveness to the mitogenic activity of high glucose. We propose that weaning triggers a discrete maturation step of β cells, elevating both the mitogenic and secretory response to glucose.},

The loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells, in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively, put these cells at the center of the disease initiation and progression. Therefore, major efforts have been taken to restore the β-cell mass by cell-replacement or regeneration approaches. Implementing novel therapies requires deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate β-cells and determine the acquisition of their physiological phenotype. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the postnatal maturation of β-cells and define their functional identity. Furthermore, we discuss different routes by which β-cells lose their features and functionality in type 1 and 2 diabetic conditions. We then focus on potential mechanisms to restore the functionality of those β-cell populations that have lost their functional phenotype. Finally, we discuss the recent progress and remaining challenges facing the generation of functional mature β-cells from stem cells for cell-replacement therapy for diabetes treatment.},

	abstract = {When cells release hormones and neurotransmitters through exocytosis, cytosolic Ca(2+) triggers the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. It is well known that this fusion requires assembly of a SNARE protein complex. However, the timing of SNARE assembly relative to vesicle fusion--essential for understanding exocytosis--has not been demonstrated. To investigate this timing, we constructed a probe that detects the assembly of two plasma membrane SNAREs, SNAP25 and syntaxin-1A, through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). With two-photon imaging, we simultaneously measured FRET signals and insulin exocytosis in beta cells from the pancreatic islet of Langerhans. In some regions of the cell, we found that the SNARE complex was preassembled, which enabled rapid exocytosis. In other regions, SNARE assembly followed Ca(2+) influx, and exocytosis was slower. Thus, SNARE proteins exist in multiple stable preparatory configurations, from which Ca(2+) may trigger exocytosis through distinct mechanisms and with distinct kinetics.},

	abstract = {Glucose-induced insulin secretion (IS) by β-cells is controlled by two pathways. The triggering pathway involves ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel-dependent depolarization, Ca(2+) influx, and rise in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)), which triggers exocytosis of insulin granules. The metabolic amplifying pathway augments IS without further increasing [Ca(2+)](c). After exclusion of the contribution of actin microfilaments, we here tested whether amplification implicates microtubule-dependent granule mobilization. Mouse islets were treated with nocodazole or taxol, which completely depolymerized and polymerized tubulin. They were then perifused to measure [Ca(2+)](c) and IS. Metabolic amplification was studied during imposed steady elevation of [Ca(2+)](c) by tolbutamide or KCl or by comparing [Ca(2+)](c) and IS responses to glucose and tolbutamide. Nocodazole did not alter [Ca(2+)](c) or IS changes induced by the three secretagogues, whereas taxol caused a small inhibition of IS that is partly ascribed to a decrease in [Ca(2+)](c). When [Ca(2+)](c) was elevated and controlled by KCl or tolbutamide, the amplifying action of glucose was unaffected by microtubule disruption or stabilization. Both phases of IS were larger in response to glucose than tolbutamide, although triggering [Ca(2+)](c) was lower. This difference, due to amplification, persisted in nocodazole- or taxol-treated islets, even when IS was augmented fourfold by microfilament disruption with cytochalasin B or latrunculin B. In conclusion, metabolic amplification rapidly augments first and second phases of IS independently of insulin granule translocation along microtubules. We therefore extend our previous proposal that it does not implicate the cytoskeleton but corresponds to acceleration of the priming process conferring release competence to insulin granules.},

	abstract = {Phases of insulin release were studied in the perfused pancreas during a variety of glucose stimulation patterns. Patterns included staircase stimulations, constant prolonged single steps, restimulations, and ramp functions. Except at low concentrations, prolonged single steps of glucose elicited early spikes of insulin and a slowly rising second phase. Total insulin in the initial spikes increased with higher glucose concentrations. However, the time-related pattern of these spikes was similar in all cases; ratios of initial secretion rate to total insulin released were constant. Total insulin released in this early phase approximated a sigmoidal function of glucose concentration; mathematical differentiation of this function gave a skewed bell-shaped distribution curve. Staircase stimulations caused insulin to be released as a series of transient spikes which did not correlate with the increment of glucose but rather to the available insulin for a given glucose concentration minus that released in previous steps. The sum of total insulin released as spikes in a staircase series leading to a given glucose concentration was the same as when that concentration was used as a single step. Interrupted prolonged glucose infusions indicated the second phase of insulin release could prime the pancreas and that the first and second phases were interrelated. When glucose was perfused as ramp functions of slow, increasing, concentration, phasic response disappeared.A previous two-compartmental model was expanded to include a threshold or sensitivity distribution hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that labile insulin is not stored in a homogeneous form but as packets with a bell-shaped distribution of thresholds to glucose. These packets respond quickly when their threshold levels to glucose are reached or exceeded. Data from single step stimulations were utilized for constructing a mathematical model which simulated satisfactorily the various stimulation patterns.},

	abstract = {Glucose-induced insulin secretion in response to a step increase in blood glucose concentrations follows a biphasic time course consisting of a rapid and transient first phase followed by a slowly developing and sustained second phase. Because Type 2 diabetes involves defects of insulin secretion, manifested as a loss of first phase and a reduction of second phase, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying biphasic insulin secretion. Insulin release involves the packaging of insulin in small (diameter ≈0.3 µm) secretory granules, the trafficking of these granules to the plasma membrane, the exocytotic fusion of the granules with the plasma membrane and eventually the retrieval of the secreted membranes by endocytosis. Until recently, studies on insulin secretion have been confined to the appearance of insulin in the extracellular space and the cellular events preceding exocytosis have been inaccessible to more detailed analysis. Evidence from a variety of secretory tissues, including pancreatic islet cells suggests, however, that the secretory granules can be functionally divided into distinct pools that are distinguished by their release competence and/or proximity to the plasma membrane. The introduction of fluorescent proteins that can be targeted to the secretory granules, in combination with the advent of new techniques that allow real-time imaging of granule trafficking in living cells (granule dynamics), has led to an explosion of our knowledge of the pre-exocytotic and post-exocytotic processes in the beta cell. Here we discuss these observations in relation to previous functional and ultra-structural data as well as the secretory defects of Type 2 diabetes.},

In sharp contrast, 16.7 mM glucose ([G16.7]) applied simultaneously with [K+50] elicits an insulin response markedly greater than that produced by [K+50] alone, which is not attenuated by 100 uM diazoxide, an inhibitor of K+ATP channel closure. [G16.7]-induced insulin secretion at the basal K+ concn of 4.7 mM was greatly (93\%) suppressed by 100 uM diazoxide. Insulin secretion induced by [K+50] plus [G16.7] ([K+50 + G16.7]) was markedly suppressed (70\%) by 1 uM nifedipine, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker and was completely abolished by 2 mM 2-cyclohexen-1-one, which reportedly decreases reduced glutathione level and blocks glucokinase. This finding indicates that insulin release induced by [K+50 + G16.7] is not due to leakage produced by toxic stimuli but to activation of exocytosis. When graded concentrations (25 and 50 mM) of K+ were applied simultaneously with [G16.7] in the presence of 100 uM diazoxide, insulin response was clearly dependent on K+ concentration, indicating that the physiological range of membrane depolarization also activates the glucose-responsive effector. Membrane depolarization/Ca2+ influx directly stimulates hormone exocytosis on one hand and activates the K+ATP channel-independent glucose-responsive effector or effectors on the other in the B-cell. The nature of the glucose-responsive effector or effectors remains to be established.},

Here, we characterized the effects of glucose in beta-cells lacking K ATP channels because of a knockout (KO) of the pore-forming subunit Kir6.2. Islets from 1-yr and 2-wk-old Kir6.2KO mice were used freshly after isolation and after 18 h culture to measure glucose effects on [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion. Kir6.2KO islets were insensitive to diazoxide and tolbutamide. In fresh adult Kir6.2KO islets, basal [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion were marginally elevated, and high glucose increased [Ca2+]c only transiently, so that the secretory response was minimal (10\% of controls) despite a functioning amplifying pathway (evidenced in 30 mm KCl). Culture in 10 mm glucose increased basal secretion and considerably improved glucose-induced insulin secretion (200\% of controls), unexpectedly because of an increase in [Ca2+]c with modulation of [Ca2+]c oscillations. Similar results were obtained in 2-wk-old Kir6.2KO islets. Under selected conditions, high glucose evoked biphasic increases in [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion, by inducing K ATP channel-independent depolarization and Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. In conclusion, Kir6.2KO beta-cells down-regulate insulin secretion by maintaining low [Ca2+]c, but culture reveals a glucose-responsive phenotype mainly by increasing [Ca2+]c. The results support models implicating a K ATP channel-independent amplifying pathway in glucose-induced insulin secretion, and show that K ATP channels are not the only possible transducers of metabolic effects on the triggering Ca2+ signal.},

Although the resting membrane potential and basal intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) of pancreatic beta cells in Kir6.2(-/-) are significantly higher than those in control mice (Kir6.2(+/+)), neither glucose at high concentrations nor the sulfonylurea tolbutamide elicits a rise in [Ca2+]i, and no significant insulin secretion in response to either glucose or tolbutamide is found in Kir6.2(-/-), as assessed by perifusion and batch incubation of pancreatic islets. Despite the defect in glucose-induced insulin secretion, Kir6.2(-/-) show only mild impairment in glucose tolerance. The glucose-lowering effect of insulin, as assessed by an insulin tolerance test, is increased significantly in Kir6.2(-/-), which could protect Kir6.2(-/-) from developing hyperglycemia. Our data indicate that the KATP channel in pancreatic beta cells is a key regulator of both glucose- and sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion and suggest also that the KATP channel in skeletal muscle might be involved in insulin action.},

It is unclear if and how nutrients can regulate insulin secretion by beta-cells lacking K(ATP) channels (Sur1 knockout mice). We compared glucose- and amino acid-induced insulin secretion and [Ca(2+)](i) changes in control and Sur1KO islets. In 1 mm glucose (non-stimulatory for controls), the triggering signal [Ca(2+)](i) was high (loss of regulation) and insulin secretion was stimulated in Sur1KO islets. This "basal" secretion was decreased or increased by imposed changes in [Ca(2+)](i) and was dependent on ATP production, indicating that both triggering and amplifying signals are involved. High glucose stimulated insulin secretion in Sur1KO islets, by an unsuspected, transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a sustained activation of the amplifying pathway. Unlike controls, Sur1KO islets were insensitive to diazoxide and tolbutamide, which rules out effects of either drug at sites other than K(ATP) channels. Amino acids potently increased insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets through both a further electrogenic rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and a metabolism-dependent activation of the amplifying pathway. After sulfonylurea blockade of their K(ATP) channels, control islets qualitatively behaved like Sur1KO islets, but their insulin secretion rate was consistently lower for a similar or even higher [Ca(2+)](i). In conclusion, fuel secretagogues can control insulin secretion in beta-cells without K(ATP) channels, partly by an unsuspected influence on the triggering [Ca(2+)](i) signal and mainly by the modulation of a very effective amplifying pathway.},

	abstract = {Background
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common chronic diseases. Studies on T2D are mainly built upon bulk-cell data analysis, which measures the average gene expression levels for a population of cells and cannot capture the inter-cell heterogeneity. The single-cell RNA-sequencing technology can provide additional information about the molecular mechanisms of T2D at single-cell level.

Results
In this work, we analyze three datasets of single-cell transcriptomes to reveal β-cell dysfunction and deficit mechanisms in T2D. Focused on the expression levels of key genes, we conduct discrimination of healthy and T2D β-cells using five machine learning classifiers, and extracted major influential factors by calculating correlation coefficients and mutual information. Our analysis shows that T2D β-cells are normal in insulin gene expression in the scenario of low cellular stress (especially oxidative stress), but appear dysfunctional under the circumstances of high cellular stress. Remarkably, oxidative stress plays an important role in affecting the expression of insulin gene. In addition, by analyzing the genes related to apoptosis, we found that the TNFR1-, BAX-, CAPN1- and CAPN2-dependent pathways may be crucial for β-cell apoptosis in T2D. Finally, personalized analysis indicates cell heterogeneity and individual-specific insulin gene expression.

Conclusions
Oxidative stress is an important influential factor on insulin gene expression in T2D. Based on the uncovered mechanism of β-cell dysfunction and deficit, targeting key genes in the apoptosis pathway along with alleviating oxidative stress could be a potential treatment strategy for T2D.

Since pancreatic islets are central to type 2 diabetes (T2D), we profiled 15,298 islet cells by using combinatorial barcoding snATAC-seq and identified 12 clusters, including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell states. We cataloged 228,873 accessible chromatin sites and identified transcription factors underlying lineage- and state-specific regulation. We observed state-specific enrichment of fasting glucose and T2D genome-wide association studies for beta cells and enrichment for other endocrine cell types. At T2D signals localized to islet-accessible chromatin, we prioritized variants with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. A causal T2D variant rs231361 at the KCNQ1 locus had predicted effects on a beta cell enhancer co-accessible with INS and genome editing in embryonic stem cell–derived beta cells affected INS levels. Together our findings demonstrate the power of single-cell epigenomics for interpreting complex disease genetics.},

Here, we show that singlecell heterogeneity analysis may overcome this hurdle by significantly improving the test sensitivity. We analyzed the transcriptome of 39,905 single islets cells from 9 donors and observed distinct β cell heterogeneity trajectories associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore developed RePACT, a sensitive single-cell analysis algorithm to identify both common and specific signature genes for obesity and T2D. We mapped both β-cell-specific genes and disease signature genes to the insulin regulatory network identified from a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Our integrative analysis discovered the previously unrecognized roles of the cohesin loading complex and the NuA4/Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex in regulating insulin transcription and release.

Additionally, studies on hMPCs have been hindered by few isolation methods that allow for the recovery of live cells. Here, we investigated the tip progenitor domain in the branched epithelium of human fetal pancreas between 13.5 and 17.5 gestational weeks by immunohistological staining. We also used a novel RNA‐based technology to isolate live cells followed by gene expression analyses. We identified cells co‐expressing SOX9 and PTF1A, two transcription factors known to be important for pancreatic MPCs, within the tips of the epithelium and observed a decrease in their proportions over time. Pancreatic SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells were enriched for MPC markers, including MYC and GATA6. These cells were proliferative and appeared active in branching morphogenesis and matrix remodeling, as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis. We identified a hub of genes pertaining to the expanding tip progenitor niche, such as FOXF1, GLI3, TBX3, FGFR1, TGFBR2, ITGAV, ITGA2, and ITGB3. YAP1 of the Hippo pathway emerged as a highly enriched component within the SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing further corroborated the findings by identifying a cluster of SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells with multipotent characteristics. Based on these results, we propose that the SOX9+/PTF1A+ cells in the human pancreas are uncommitted MPC‐like cells that reside at the tips of the expanding pancreatic epithelium, directing self‐renewal and inducing pancreatic organogenesis. stem cells translational medicine

This revealed the range of molecular and functional changes that occur during beta cell aging, including the transcriptional deregulation that associates with cellular immaturity and reorganization of beta cell TF networks, increased gene transcription rates, and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin release. These alterations associate with activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy pathways.

	abstract = {Background
Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated actions of hormone-producing endocrine cells that reside in pancreatic islets. Islet cell malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression. Due to the cellular heterogeneity within islets, it has been challenging to uncover how specific islet cells contribute to glucose homeostasis and diabetes pathogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell technologies and computational methods have opened up new avenues to resolve islet heterogeneity and study islet cell states in health and disease.
Scope of review
In the past year, a multitude of studies have been published that used single-cell approaches to interrogate the transcriptome and proteome of the different islet cell types. Here, we summarize the conclusions of these studies, as well as discuss the technologies used and the challenges faced with computational analysis of single-cell data from islet studies.
Major conclusions
By analyzing single islet cells from rodents and humans at different ages and disease states, the studies reviewed here have provided new insight into endocrine cell function and facilitated a high resolution molecular characterization of poorly understood processes, including regeneration, maturation, and diabetes pathogenesis. Gene expression programs and pathways identified in these studies pave the way for the discovery of new targets and approaches to prevent, monitor, and treat diabetes.},

Recent advances in molecular technologies, in particular single-cell profiling on both the protein and messenger RNA level, have uncovered that β-cells exist in several antigenically and molecularly definable states. Using antibodies to cell surface markers or multidimensional clustering of β-cells using more than 20 protein markers by mass cytometry, 4 distinct groups of β-cells could be differentiated. However, whether these states represent permanent cell lineages or are readily interconvertible from one group to another remains to be determined. Nevertheless, future analysis of the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes will certainly benefit from a growing appreciation of β-cell heterogeneity.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is necessary to perform this type of analysis in frozen or difficult-to-dissociate tissues, which cannot be subjected to scRNA-seq. This difference in the state of tissues leads to variation in cell-type distributions among each platform. To identify the characteristics of these methods and their differences, scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq were performed in parallel for colon and liver tissues. The two platforms revealed similar diversity but different proportions of cell types in matched tissues. The proportions of epithelial cells in the colon and hepatocytes in the liver were relatively high in snRNA-seq and that of immune cells was relatively high in scRNA-seq. This difference could be explained by variations in the expression scores of adhesion genes due to the disruption of the cytoplasmic contents during scRNA-seq. The enrichment of epithelial cells in the colon resulted in a discrepancy in the differentiation of epithelial cells. This enrichment was also well matched with the images of hematoxylin and eosin staining and the estimated distribution of cell types in bulk RNA sequencing. These results showed that snRNA-seq could be used to analyze tissues that cannot be subjected to scRNA-seq and provides more information in specific cell type analysis.},

	abstract = {Aims/Introduction Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the circulation. In this study, we investigated cell signaling in the amplification of insulin secretion by glutamine. Materials and Methods Clonal pancreatic β-cells MIN6-K8, wild-type B6 mouse islets, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) knockout clonal β-cells (Glud1KOβCL), and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) knockout clonal β-cells (Got1KOβCL) were studied. Insulin secretion from these cells and islets was examined under various conditions, and intracellular glutamine metabolism was assessed by metabolic flux analysis. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was also measured. Results Glutamine dose-dependently amplified insulin secretion in the presence of high glucose in both MIN6-K8 cells and Glud1KOβCL. Inhibition of glutaminases, the enzymes that convert glutamine to glutamate, dramatically reduced the glutamine-amplifying effect on insulin secretion. A substantial amount of glutamate was produced from glutamine through direct conversion by glutaminases. Glutamine also increased [Ca2+]i at high glucose, which was abolished by inhibition of glutaminases. Glutamic acid dimethylester (dm-Glu), a membrane permeable glutamate precursor that is converted to glutamate in cells, increased [Ca2+]i as well as induced insulin secretion at high glucose. These effects of glutamine and dm-Glu were dependent on calcium influx. Glutamine also induced insulin secretion in clonal β-cells MIN6-m14, which otherwise exhibit no insulin secretory response to glucose. Conclusions Glutamate converted from glutamine is an essential mediator that enhances calcium signaling in the glutamine-amplifying effect on insulin secretion. Our data also suggest that glutamine exerts a permissive effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion.},

	abstract = {Objective
α/β-Hydrolase domain-6 (ABHD6) is a newly identified monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase. We recently reported that it negatively regulates glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the β cells by hydrolyzing lipolysis-derived MAG that acts as a metabolic coupling factor and signaling molecule via exocytotic regulator Munc13-1. Whether ABHD6 and MAG play a role in response to all classes of insulin secretagogues, in particular various fuel and non-fuel stimuli, is unknown.
Methods
Insulin secretion in response to various classes of secretagogues, exogenous MAG and pharmacological agents was measured in islets of mice deficient in ABHD6 specifically in the β cell (BKO). Islet perifusion experiments and determinations of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, cytosolic Ca2+ and MAG species levels were carried out.
Results
Deletion of ABHD6 potentiated insulin secretion in response to the fuels glutamine plus leucine and α-ketoisocaproate and to the non-fuel stimuli glucagon-like peptide 1, carbamylcholine and elevated KCl. Fatty acids amplified GSIS in control and BKO mice to the same extent. Exogenous 1-MAG amplified insulin secretion in response to fuel and non-fuel stimuli. MAG hydrolysis activity was greatly reduced in BKO islets without changes in total diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol lipase activity. ABHD6 deletion induced insulin secretion independently from KATP channels and did not alter the glucose induced rise in intracellular Ca2+. Perifusion studies showed elevated insulin secretion during second phase of GSIS in BKO islets that was not due to altered cytosolic Ca2+ signaling or because of changes in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Glucose increased islet saturated long chain 1-MAG species and ABHD6 deletion caused accumulation of these 1-MAG species at both low and elevated glucose.
Conclusion
ABHD6 regulates insulin secretion in response to fuel stimuli at large and some non-fuel stimuli by controlling long chain saturated 1-MAG levels that synergize with other signaling pathways for secretion.},

	abstract = {The “second messenger” archetype cAMP is one of the most important cellular signalling molecules with central functions including the regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreatic β- and α-cells, respectively. cAMP is generally considered as an amplifier of insulin secretion triggered by Ca2+ elevation in the β-cells. Both messengers are also positive modulators of glucagon release from α-cells, but in this case cAMP may be the important regulator and Ca2+ have a more permissive role. The actions of cAMP are mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac. The present review focuses on how cAMP is regulated by nutrients, hormones and neural factors in β- and α-cells via adenylyl cyclase-catalysed generation and phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation. We will also discuss how PKA and Epac affect ion fluxes and the secretory machinery to transduce the stimulatory effects on insulin and glucagon secretion. Finally, we will briefly describe disturbances of the cAMP system associated with diabetes and how cAMP signalling can be targeted to normalize hypo- and hypersecretion of insulin and glucagon, respectively, in diabetic patients.},

	abstract = {The consensus model of stimulus-secretion coupling in beta cells attributes glucose-induced insulin secretion to a sequence of events involving acceleration of metabolism, closure of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, depolarisation, influx of Ca(2+) and a rise in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)). This triggering pathway is essential, but would not be very efficient if glucose did not also activate a metabolic amplifying pathway that does not raise [Ca(2+)](c) further but augments the action of triggering Ca(2+) on exocytosis. This review discusses how both pathways interact to achieve temporal control and amplitude modulation of biphasic insulin secretion. First-phase insulin secretion is triggered by the rise in [Ca(2+)](c) that occurs synchronously in all beta cells of every islet in response to a sudden increase in the glucose concentration. Its time course and duration are shaped by those of the Ca(2+) signal, and its amplitude is modulated by the magnitude of the [Ca(2+)](c) rise and, substantially, by amplifying mechanisms. During the second phase, synchronous [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations in all beta cells of an individual islet induce pulsatile insulin secretion, but these features of the signal and response are dampened in groups of intrinsically asynchronous islets. Glucose has hardly any influence on the amplitude of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations and mainly controls the time course of triggering signal. Amplitude modulation of insulin secretion pulses largely depends on the amplifying pathway. There are more similarities than differences between the two phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Both are subject to the same dual, hierarchical control over time and amplitude by triggering and amplifying pathways, suggesting that the second phase is a sequence of iterations of the first phase.},

	abstract = {Physiologically, insulin secretion is subject to a dual, hierarchal control by triggering and amplifying pathways. By closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) in the plasma membrane, glucose and other metabolized nutrients depolarize β-cells, stimulate Ca2+ influx, and increase the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which constitutes the indispensable triggering signal to induce exocytosis of insulin granules. The increase in β-cell metabolism also generates amplifying signals that augment the efficacy of Ca2+ on the exocytotic machinery. Stimulatory hormones and neurotransmitters modestly increase the triggering signal and strongly activate amplifying pathways biochemically distinct from that set into operation by nutrients. Many drugs can increase insulin secretion in vitro, but only few have a therapeutic potential. This review identifies six major pathways or sites of stimulus-secretion coupling that could be aimed by potential insulin-secreting drugs and describes several strategies to reach these targets. It also discusses whether these perspectives are realistic or theoretical only. These six possible β-cell targets are 1) stimulation of metabolism, 2) increase of [Ca2+]i by closure of K+ATP channels, 3) increase of [Ca2+]i by other means, 4) stimulation of amplifying pathways, 5) action on membrane receptors, and 6) action on nuclear receptors. The theoretical risk of inappropriate insulin secretion and, hence, of hypoglycemia linked to these different approaches is also envisaged.},

	abstract = {The function and survival of pancreatic β cells critically rely on complex electrical signaling systems composed of a series of ionic events, namely fluxes of K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Cl− across the β cell membranes. These electrical signaling systems not only sense events occurring in the extracellular space and intracellular milieu of pancreatic islet cells, but also control different β cell activities, most notably glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Three major ion fluxes including K+ efflux through ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, the voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channel-mediated Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux through voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels operate in the β cell. These ion fluxes set the resting membrane potential and the shape, rate and pattern of firing of action potentials under different metabolic conditions. The KATP channel-mediated K+ efflux determines the resting membrane potential and keeps the excitability of the β cell at low levels. Ca2+ influx through CaV1 channels, a major type of β cell CaV channels, causes the upstroke or depolarization phase of the action potential and regulates a wide range of β cell functions including the most elementary β cell function, insulin secretion. K+ efflux mediated by KV2.1 delayed rectifier K+ channels, a predominant form of β cell KV channels, brings about the downstroke or repolarization phase of the action potential, which acts as a brake for insulin secretion owing to shutting down the CaV channel-mediated Ca2+ entry. These three ion channel-mediated ion fluxes are the most important ionic events in β cell signaling. This review concisely discusses various ionic mechanisms in β cell signaling and highlights KATP channel-, CaV1 channel- and KV2.1 channel-mediated ion fluxes.},

	abstract = {Finding novel causes for monogenic forms of diabetes is important as, alongside the clinical implications of such a discovery, it can identify critical proteins and pathways required for normal beta cell function in humans. It is increasingly apparent that there are significant differences between rodent and human islets. One example that has generated interest is the relative importance of the glucose transporter GLUT2 in rodent and human beta cells. The central role of GLUT2 in rodent beta cells is well established, but a number of studies have suggested that other glucose transporters, namely GLUT1 and GLUT3, may play an important role in facilitating glucose transport into human beta cells. In this issue of Diabetologia Sansbury et al (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-012-2595-0 ) report homozygous loss of function mutations in SLC2A2, which encodes GLUT2, as a rare cause of neonatal diabetes. Evidence for a beta cell defect in these subjects comes from very low birthweights, lack of endogenous insulin secretion and a requirement for insulin therapy. Neonatal diabetes is not a consistent feature of SLC2A2 mutations. It is only found in a small percentage of cases ({\textasciitilde}4\%) and the diabetes largely resolves before 18 months of age. This discovery is significant as it suggests that GLUT2 plays an important role in human beta cells, but the interplay and relative roles of other transporters differ from those in rodents. This finding should encourage efforts to delineate the precise role of GLUT2 in the human beta cell at different developmental time points and is a further reminder of critical differences between human and rodent islets.},

	abstract = {Glucose stimulates insulin secretion by generating triggering and amplifying signals in beta-cells. The triggering pathway is well characterized. It involves the following sequence of events: entry of glucose by facilitated diffusion, metabolism of glucose by oxidative glycolysis, rise in the ATP-to-ADP ratio, closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx, rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and activation of the exocytotic machinery. The amplifying pathway can be studied when beta-cell [Ca2+]i is elevated and clamped by a depolarization with either a high concentration of sulfonylurea or a high concentration of K+ in the presence of diazoxide (K(ATP) channels are then respectively blocked or held open). Under these conditions, glucose still increases insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase in secretion is highly sensitive to glucose (produced by as little as 1-6 mmol/l glucose), requires glucose metabolism, is independent of activation of protein kinases A and C, and does not seem to implicate long-chain acyl-CoAs. Changes in adenine nucleotides may be involved. The amplification consists of an increase in efficacy of Ca2+ on exocytosis of insulin granules. There exists a clear hierarchy between both pathways. The triggering pathway predominates over the amplifying pathway, which remains functionally silent as long as [Ca2+]i has not been raised by the first pathway; i.e., as long as glucose has not reached its threshold concentration. The alteration of this hierarchy by long-acting sulfonylureas or genetic inactivation of K(ATP) channels may lead to inappropriate insulin secretion at low glucose. The amplifying pathway serves to optimize the secretory response not only to glucose but also to nonglucose stimuli. It is impaired in beta-cells of animal models of type 2 diabetes, and indirect evidence suggests that it is altered in beta-cells of type 2 diabetic patients. Besides the available drugs that act on K(ATP) channels and increase the triggering signal, novel drugs that correct a deficient amplifying pathway would be useful to restore adequate insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients.},

Whereas this KATP channel-dependent mechanism of GSIS has been broadly accepted for more than 30 years, it has become increasingly apparent that it does not fully describe the effects of glucose on insulin secretion. More recent studies have demonstrated an important role for cyclic pathways of pyruvate metabolism in control of insulin secretion. Three cycles occur in islet β-cells: the pyruvate/malate, pyruvate/citrate, and pyruvate/isocitrate cycles. This review discusses recent work on the role of each of these pathways in control of insulin secretion and builds a case for the particular relevance of byproducts of the pyruvate/isocitrate cycle, NADPH and α-ketoglutarate, in control of GSIS.},

	abstract = {The development of insulin-producing pancreatic beta (β)-cells represents the culmination of a complex developmental program. Cells of the posterior foregut assume a pancreatic identity, cells within the expanding pancreatic primordia adopt an endocrine fate, and a subset of these precursors becomes competent to generate β-cells. Postnatally, β-cells are primarily maintained by self-duplication rather than new differentiation. Although major gaps in our knowledge still persist, experiments across several organisms have shed increasing light on the steps of β-cell specification and differentiation. Increasing our understanding of the extrinsic, as well as intrinsic, mechanisms that control these processes should facilitate efforts to regenerate this important cell type in humans.},

	abstract = {The pancreas is an organ containing two distinct populations of cells, the exocrine cells that secrete enzymes into the digestive tract, and the endocrine cells that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. It arises from the endoderm as a dorsal and a ventral bud which fuse together to form the single organ. Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have a pancreas with similar histology and mode of development, while in some fish, the islet cells are segregated as Brockmann bodies. Invertebrates do not have a pancreas, but comparable endocrine cells may be found in the gut or the brain. The early pancreatic bud shows uniform expression of the homeobox gene IPF-1 (also known as IDX-1, STF-1 or PDX), which when mutated to inactivity leads to total absence of the organ. The occurrence of heterotopic pancreas in the embryo, and also the metaplasias that can be displayed by a regenerating pancreas in the adult, both suggest that only a few gene products distinguish the pancreatic cell state from that of the surrounding tissues of duodenum, gall bladder and liver. In the developing pancreatic buds, the endocrine cells start to differentiate before the exocrine cells, and co-expression of different hormones by the same cell is often observed at early stages. Although pancreatic endocrine cells produce many gene products also characteristic of neurons, evidence from in vitro cultures and from quailchick grafts shows that they are of endogenous and not of neural crest origin. Observational studies suggest strongly that both endocrine and exocrine cells arise from the same endodermal rudiment. Development of the pancreas in embryonic life requires a trophic stimulus from the associated mesenchyme. In postnatal life, all cell types in the pancreas continue to grow. Destruction of acinar tissue by duct ligation or ethionine treatment is followed by rapid regeneration. Surgical removal of parts of the pancreas is followed by moderate but incomplete regeneration of both acini and islets. Poisoning with alloxan or streptozotocin can lead to permanent depletion of beta cells. Although the cell kinetics of the pancreas are not understood, it seems likely that there is a continuous slow turnover of cells, fed from a stem cells population in the ducts, and that the controls on the production rate of each cell type are local rather than systemic.},

	abstract = {Insulin secretion is triggered by a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration that results from the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the β-cell plasma membrane. Multiple types of β-cell Ca2+ channel have been identified in both electrophysiological and molecular biological studies, but it appears that the L-type Ca2+ channel plays a dominant role in regulating Ca2+ influx. Activity of this channel is potentiated by protein kinases A and C and is inhibited by GTP-binding proteins, which may mediate the effects of potentiators and inhibitors of insulin secretion on Ca2+ influx, respectively. The mechanism by which elevation of intracellular Ca2+ leads to the release of insulin granules is not fully understood but appears to involve activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase A or C, probably at different substrates, potentiates insulin secretion by acting at some late stage in the secretory process. There is also evidence that small GTP-binding proteins are involved in regulating exocytosis in β cells. The identification and characterisation of the proteins involved in exocytosis in β cells and clarification of the mechanism(s) of action of Ca2+ is clearly an important goal for the future. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {SLC2A2 encoding glucose transporter − 2 (GLUT2) acts as the primary glucose transporter and sensor in rodent pancreatic islets and is widely assumed to play a similar role in humans. In healthy adults SLC2A2 variants are associated with elevated fasting plasma glucose (fpg) concentrations but physiological characterisation does not support a defect in pancreatic beta-cell function. Interspecies differences can create barriers for the follow up of disease association signals. We hypothesised that GLUT2 is not the principal glucose transporter in human beta-cells and that SLC2A2 variants exert their effect on fpg levels through defects in other tissues. SLC2A1–4 (GLUT 1–4) mRNA expression levels were determined in human and mouse islets, beta-cells, liver, muscle and adipose tissue by qRT-PCR whilst GLUT1–3 protein levels were examined by immunohistochemistry. The presence of all three glucose transporters was demonstrated in human and mouse islets and puriﬁed beta-cells. Quantitative expression proﬁling demonstrated that Slc2a2 is the predominant glucose transporter (expression N 10 fold higher that Slc2a1) in mouse islets whilst SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 predominate in both human islets and beta-cells (expression 2.8 and 2.7 fold higher than SLC2A2 respectively). Our data therefore suggest that GLUT2 is unlikely to be the principal glucose transporter in human beta-cells and that SLC2A2 defects in other metabolic tissues drive the observed differences in glucose levels between carriers of SLC2A2 variants. Direct extrapolation from rodent to human islet glucose transporter activity is unlikely to be appropriate.},

We analyzed the transcriptomes of single Pdx1low and Pdx1high cells from the DPR and VPR. In the VPR, Pdx1low cells have an intermediate progenitor identity and can generate hepatoblasts, extrahepatobiliary cells, and Pdx1high pancreatic progenitor cells. In the DPR, Pdx1high cells are directly specified as pancreatic progenitors, whereas Pdx1low cells are precocious endocrine cells. Therefore, our study defines distinct road maps for dorsal and ventral pancreatic progenitor specification.

	abstract = {Pancreas oganogenesis comprises a coordinated and highly complex interplay of signaling events and transcriptional networks that guide a step-wise process of organ development from early bud specification all the way to the final mature organ state. Extensive research on pancreas development over the last few years, largely driven by a translational potential for pancreatic diseases (diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and so on), is markedly advancing our knowledge of these processes. It is a tenable goal that we will one day have a clear, complete picture of the transcriptional and signaling codes that control the entire organogenetic process, allowing us to apply this knowledge in a therapeutic context, by generating replacement cells in vitro, or perhaps one day to the whole organ in vivo. This review summarizes findings in the past 5 years that we feel are amongst the most significant in contributing to the deeper understanding of pancreas development. Rather than try to cover all aspects comprehensively, we have chosen to highlight interesting new concepts, and to discuss provocatively some of the more controversial findings or proposals. At the end of the review, we include a perspective section on how the whole pancreas differentiation process might be able to be unwound in a regulated fashion, or redirected, and suggest linkages to the possible reprogramming of other pancreatic cell-types in vivo, and to the optimization of the forward-directed-differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC), or induced pluripotential cells (iPSC), towards mature β-cells.

	abstract = {Insulin release from pancreatic β-cells is required to maintain normal glucose homoeostasis in man and many other animals. Defective insulin secretion underlies all forms of diabetes mellitus, a disease currently reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Although the destruction of β-cells is responsible for Type 1 diabetes (T1D), both lowered β-cell mass and loss of secretory function are implicated in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Emerging results suggest that a functional deficiency, involving de-differentiation of the mature β-cell towards a more progenitor-like state, may be an important driver for impaired secretion in T2D. Conversely, at least in rodents, reprogramming of islet non-β to β-cells appears to occur spontaneously in models of T1D, and may occur in man. In the present paper, we summarize the biochemical properties which define the ‘identity’ of the mature β-cell as a glucose sensor par excellence. In particular, we discuss the importance of suppressing a group of 11 ‘disallowed’ housekeeping genes, including Ldha and the monocarboxylate transporter Mct1 (Slc16a1), for normal nutrient sensing. We then survey the changes in the expression and/or activity of β-cell-enriched transcription factors, including FOXO1, PDX1, NKX6.1, MAFA and RFX6, as well as non-coding RNAs, which may contribute to β-cell de-differentiation and functional impairment in T2D. The relevance of these observations for the development of new approaches to treat T1D and T2D is considered.},

The secretion of these hormones from pancreatic β-cells and α-cells, respectively, is controlled by metabolic, endocrine, and paracrine regulatory mechanisms and is essential for the control of blood levels of glucose. The deregulation of these mechanisms leads to various pathologies, most notably type 2 diabetes, which is driven by the combined lesions of impaired insulin action and a loss of the normal insulin secretion response to glucose. Glucose stimulates insulin secretion from β-cells in a bi-modal fashion, and new insights about the underlying mechanisms, particularly relating to the second or amplifying phase of this secretory response, have been recently gained. Other recent work highlights the importance of α-cell-produced proglucagon-derived peptides, incretin hormones from the gastrointestinal tract and other dietary components, including certain amino acids and fatty acids, in priming and potentiation of the β-cell glucose response.

Furthermore, the ability of novel single cell technologies to characterize the molecular identity of individual beta cells has created a new era in the beta cell field. These studies are providing important novel information about the origin of beta cell heterogeneity, the type and proportions of the different beta cell subpopulations, as well as their intrinsic properties. Furthermore, characterization of different beta cell subpopulations that could variably offer protection from or drive progression of diabetes has important clinical implications in diabetes prevention, beta cell regeneration and stem cell treatments. In this review, we will assess the evidence that supports the existence of heterogeneous populations of beta cells and the factors that could influence their formation.

	abstract = {Beta cells are primarily defined by their ability to produce insulin and secrete it in response to appropriate stimuli. It has been known for some time, however, that beta cells are not functionally identical to each other and that the rates of insulin synthesis and release differ from cell to cell, although the functional significance of this variability remains unclear. Recent studies have used heterogeneous gene expression to isolate and evaluate different subpopulations of beta cells and to demonstrate alterations in these subpopulations in diabetes. In the last few years, novel technologies have emerged that permit the detailed evaluation of the proteome (e.g. time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, [CyTOF]) and transcriptome (e.g. massively parallel RNA sequencing) at the single-cell level, and tools for single beta cell metabolomics and epigenomics are quickly maturing. The first wave of single beta cell proteome and transcriptome studies were published in 2016, giving a glimpse into the power, but also the limitations, of these approaches. Despite this progress, it remains unclear if the observed heterogeneity of beta cells represents stable, distinct beta cell types or, alternatively, highly dynamic beta cell states. Here we provide a concise overview of recent developments in the emerging field of beta cell heterogeneity and the implications for our understanding of beta cell biology and pathology.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis
Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and trigger transcriptional regulation of genes important for islet response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile Ca2+-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular Ca2+ signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity.

Methods
We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mmol/l glucose; (2) 16 mmol/l glucose and 40 mmol/l KCl to maximally stimulate Ca2+ signalling; and (3) 16 mmol/l glucose, 40 mmol/l KCl and 5 mmol/l EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) to inhibit Ca2+ signalling, for 1 h. We sequenced 68,650 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 59,373 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed Ca2+-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.

Results
Based on the number of Ca2+-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of Ca2+ response. We also showed that polyhormonal clusters expressing both INS and GCG, or both INS and SST, are defined by Ca2+-regulated genes specific to each cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of Ca2+-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function.

Conclusions/interpretation
Here we use our large-scale, multi-condition, single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific Ca2+-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of Ca2+-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

	abstract = {Aims
Spatially-organized increases in cytosolic Ca2+ within pancreatic beta cells in the pancreatic islet underlie the stimulation of insulin secretion by high glucose. Recent data have revealed the existence of subpopulations of beta cells including “leaders” which initiate Ca2+ waves. Whether leader cells possess unique molecular features, or localisation, is unknown.
Main methods
High speed confocal Ca2+ imaging was used to identify leader cells and connectivity analysis, running under MATLAB and Python, to identify highly connected “hub” cells. To explore transcriptomic differences between beta cell sub-groups, individual leaders or followers were labelled by photo-activation of the cryptic fluorescent protein PA-mCherry and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing (“Flash-Seq”).
Key findings
Distinct Ca2+ wave types were identified in individual islets, with leader cells present in 73 \% (28 of 38 islets imaged). Scale-free, power law-adherent behaviour was also observed in 29 \% of islets, though “hub” cells in these islets did not overlap with leaders. Transcripts differentially expressed (295; padj {\textless} 0.05) between leader and follower cells included genes involved in cilium biogenesis and transcriptional regulation. Providing some support for these findings, ADCY6 immunoreactivity tended to be higher in leader than follower cells, whereas cilia number and length tended to be lower in the former. Finally, leader cells were located significantly closer to delta, but not alpha, cells in Euclidian space than were follower cells.
Significance
The existence of both a discrete transcriptome and unique localisation implies a role for these features in defining the specialized function of leaders. These data also raise the possibility that localised signalling between delta and leader cells contributes to the initiation and propagation of islet Ca2+ waves.},

One subset of beta cells marked by high CD63 expression is enriched for the expression of mitochondrial metabolism genes and exhibits higher mitochondrial respiration compared with CD63lo beta cells. Human and murine pseudo-islets derived from CD63hi beta cells demonstrate enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared with pseudo-islets from CD63lo beta cells. We show that CD63hi beta cells are diminished in mouse models of and in humans with type 2 diabetes. Finally, transplantation of pseudo-islets generated from CD63hi but not CD63lo beta cells into diabetic mice restores glucose homeostasis.

To understand whether the competence of pancreatic progenitors changes over time, we generated transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Ngn3 fusion protein under the control of the pdx1 promoter and backcrossed the transgene into the ngn3−/− background, devoid of endogenous endocrine cells. Early activation of Ngn3-ERTM almost exclusively induced glucagon+ cells, while depleting the pool of pancreas progenitors. As from E11.5, Pdx1+ progenitors became competent to differentiate into insulin+ and PP+ cells. Somatostatin+ cells were generated from E14.5, while the competence to make glucagon+ cells was dramatically decreased. Hence, pancreas progenitors, similar to retinal or cortical progenitors, go through competence states that each allow the generation of a subset of cell types. We further show that the progenitors acquire competence to generate late-born cells in a mechanism that is intrinsic to the epithelium.},

They subsequently delaminate out of the epithelium and cluster in the mesenchyme to form the islets of Langerhans. Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) is a transcription factor required for the differentiation of all endocrine cells and we investigated its role in their delamination. We observed in the mouse pancreas that most Ngn3-positive cells have lost contact with the lumen of the epithelium, showing that the delamination from the progenitor layer is initiated in endocrine progenitors. Subsequently, in both mouse and chick newly born endocrine cells at the periphery of the epithelium strongly decrease E-cadherin, break-down the basal lamina and cluster into islets of Langerhans. Repression of E-cadherin is sufficient to promote delamination from the epithelium. We further demonstrate that Ngn3 indirectly controls Snail2 protein expression post-transcriptionally to repress E-cadherin.

	abstract = {During organogenesis, the final size of mature cell populations depends on their rates of differentiation and expansion. Because transient expression of Neurogenin3 (Neurog3) in progenitor cells in the developing pancreas initiates their differentiation to mature islet cells, we examined the role of Neurog3 in cell cycle control during this process. We found that mitotically active pancreatic progenitor cells in mouse embryos exited the cell cycle after the initiation of Neurog3 expression. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the Neurog3-expressing cells dramatically up-regulated the mRNA encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (Cdkn1a). In Neurog3 null mice, the islet progenitor cells failed to activate Cdkn1a expression and continued to proliferate, showing that their exit from the cell cycle requires Neurog3. Furthermore, induced transgenic expression of Neurog3 in mouse β-cells in vivo markedly decreased their proliferation, increased Cdkn1a levels, and eventually caused profound hyperglycemia. In contrast, in Cdkn1a null mice, proliferation was incompletely suppressed in the Neurog3-expressing cells. These studies reveal a crucial role for Neurog3 in regulating the cell cycle during the differentiation of islet cells and demonstrate that the subsequent down-regulation of Neurog3 allows the mature islet cell population to expand.},

The results provide direct evidence that NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors during embryogenesis and in adult mice. In addition, we find that cells expressing Pdx1 give rise to all three types of pancreatic tissue: exocrine, endocrine and duct. Furthermore, exocrine and endocrine cells are derived from Pdx1-expressing progenitors throughout embryogenesis. By contrast, the pancreatic duct arises from PDX1+ progenitors that are set aside around embryonic day 10.5 (E9.5-E11.5).

	abstract = {This ultrastructural analysis of pancreas development under in vivo and in vitro conditions complements earlier biochemical studies. The endocrine and exocrine tissue develops similarly in vitro. The early pancreatic epithelial cells, like those of the gut, form a single layer of cells facing the lumen, and are linked together by junctional complexes. This cellular polarization implies a constraint for the axis of division of exocrine cells, and demands that the endocrine cells loose their connection with the exocrine cells in order to form islets. The presence of mitotic figures in well differentiated acinar cells suggests that cell multiplication is not incompatible with cell differentiation. The first zymogen granules that can be observed look similar to the granules present later in development. This observation suggests that the “prozymogen granules” which were reported in earlier papers were probably the result of fixation artifacts, and did not represent a stage in granule formation between the condensing vacuoles in the Golgi and the definitive zymogen granules. The morphological observations of this study are consistent with the previously proposed biphasic model of differentiation for the exocrine and endocrine B cells. The development of specific organelles correlates with the pattern of accumulation of the specific exocrine proteins and insulin. On the other hand, differentiated A cells are present when the pancreatic bud first forms. This early appearance of differentiated A cells suggests a regulatory role for this hormone in early development.},

We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations.

Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.

To examine the output characteristics of different cross-species integration strategies, we benchmarked 25 combinations of gene homology mapping methods and integration algorithms in a variety of biological settings. We examine each strategy’s capability to perform species-mixing of known homologous cell types and preserve biological heterogeneity using 10 metrics, among which we developed a new biology conservation metric to address the maintenance of cell type distinguishability. Overall, scVI, SeuratV4 methods and SAMap achieve a balance between species-mixing and biology conservation. For evolutionarily distant species, including in-paralogs and using nearest-neighbour based methods is beneficial. SAMap outperforms when integrating whole-body atlases and can prioritize identity-defining similarities between homologous cell types in complex circumstances. We provide our freely available cross-species integration and assessment pipeline to help identify the optimum strategy to analyse new data and develop new algorithms.},

	abstract = {Aging manifests as progressive dysfunction culminating in death. The diversity of cell types is a challenge to the precise quantification of aging and its reversal. Here we develop a suite of ‘aging clocks’ based on single cell transcriptomic data to characterize cell type-specific aging and rejuvenation strategies. The subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic region contains many cell types and provides an excellent system to study cell-level tissue aging and regeneration. We generated 21,458 single-cell transcriptomes from the neurogenic regions of 28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. With these data, we trained a suite of single cell-based regression models (aging clocks) to predict both chronological age (passage of time) and biological age (fitness, in this case the proliferative capacity of the neurogenic region). Both types of clocks perform well on independent cohorts of mice. Genes underlying the single cell-based aging clocks are mostly cell-type specific, but also include a few shared genes in the interferon and lipid metabolism pathways. We used these single cell-based aging clocks to measure transcriptomic rejuvenation, by generating single cell RNA-seq datasets of SVZ neurogenic regions for two interventions –heterochronic parabiosis (young blood) and exercise. Interestingly, the use of aging clocks reveals that both heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic aging in the niche, but in different ways across cell types and genes. This study represents the first development of high-resolution aging clocks from single cell transcriptomic data and demonstrates their application to quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing has helped to grasp the complexity of the cell states and dynamic changes in GB. Large-scale data integration can help to uncover unexplored tumor pathobiology. Here, we resolved the composition of the tumor milieu and created a cellular map of GB (‘GBmap’), a curated resource that harmonizes 26 datasets gathering 240 patients and spanning over 1.1 million cells. We showcase the applications of our resource for reference mapping, transfer learning, and biological discoveries. Our results uncover the sources of pro-angiogenic signaling and the multifaceted role of mesenchymal-like cancer cells. Reconstructing the tumor architecture using spatially resolved transcriptomics unveiled a high level of well-structured neoplastic niches. The GBmap represents a framework that allows the streamlined integration and interpretation of new data and provides a platform for exploratory analysis, hypothesis generation and testing.

New technologies, such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), are enabling characterization of the biomaterial response to an unprecedented level of detail, facilitating new discoveries in the complex cellular environment surrounding materials. We performed scRNAseq and integrated data sets from multiple experiments to create a single cell atlas of the biomaterials response that contains 42,156 cells from biological extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived and synthetic polyester (polycaprolactone, PCL) scaffold biomaterials implanted in murine muscle wounds. We identified 18 clusters of cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, multiple subsets of fibroblasts, and myeloid cells, many of which were previously unknown in the biomaterial response. To determine intra and intercellular signaling occurring between the numerous cell subsets, including immune-stromal interactions in the biomaterial response, we developed Domino (github.com/chris-cherry/domino), a computational tool which allows for identification of condition specific intercellular signaling patterns connected to transcription factor activation from single cell data. The Domino networks self-assembled into signaling modules and cellular subsets involved in signaling independent of clustering, defining interactions between immune, fibroblast, and tissue-specific modules with biomaterials-specific communication patterns. Further compilation and integration of biomaterials single cell data sets will delineate the impact of materials chemical and physical properties and biological factors, such as anatomical placement, age, or systemic disease, that will direct biomaterials design.},

In application to a breast cancer Imaging Mass Cytometry dataset, our model yields robust spatial variance signatures, identifying cell-cell interactions as a major driver of expression heterogeneity. We also apply SVCA to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, where we identify molecular pathways that are linked to cell-cell interactions.},

	abstract = {Adaptation of the islet β-cell insulin secretory response to changing insulin demand is critical for blood glucose homeostasis, yet the mechanisms underlying this adaptation are unknown. Here, we show that nutrient-stimulated histone acetylation plays a key role in adapting insulin secretion through regulation of genes involved in β-cell nutrient sensing and metabolism. Nutrient regulation of the epigenome occurs at sites occupied by the chromatin-modifying enzyme Lsd1 in islets. We demonstrate that β-cell-specific deletion of Lsd1 leads to insulin hypersecretion, aberrant expression of nutrient response genes, and histone hyperacetylation. Islets from mice adapted to chronically increased insulin demand exhibited similar epigenetic and transcriptional changes. Moreover, genetic variants associated with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes are enriched at LSD1-bound sites in human islets, suggesting that interpretation of nutrient signals is genetically determined. Our findings reveal that adaptive insulin secretion involves Lsd1-mediated coupling of nutrient state to regulation of the islet epigenome},

Single cell epigenomic technologies create new opportunities to dissect cell type-specific mechanisms of risk variants, yet this approach has not been widely applied to disease-relevant tissues. Given the central role of pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology, we generated accessible chromatin profiles from 14.2k islet cells and identified 13 cell clusters including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell clusters which represented hormone-producing and signal-responsive cell states. We cataloged 244,236 islet cell type accessible chromatin sites and identified transcription factors (TFs) underlying both lineage- and state-specific regulation. We measured the enrichment of T2D and glycemic trait GWAS for the accessible chromatin profiles of single cells, which revealed heterogeneity in the effects of beta cell states and TFs on fasting glucose and T2D risk. We further used machine learning to predict the cell type-specific regulatory function of genetic variants, and single cell co-accessibility to link distal sites to putative cell type-specific target genes. We localized 239 fine-mapped T2D risk signals to islet accessible chromatin, and further prioritized variants at these signals with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. At the KCNQ1 locus, the causal T2D variant rs231361 had predicted effects on an enhancer with beta cell-specific, long-range co-accessibility to the insulin promoter, and deletion of this enhancer reduced insulin gene and protein expression in human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells. Our findings provide a cell type- and state-resolved map of gene regulation in human islets, illuminate likely mechanisms of T2D risk at hundreds of loci, and demonstrate the power of single cell epigenomics for interpreting complex disease genetics.},

To decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed β-cell proliferation in isolated rat islets exposed to glucose and oleate or palmitate for 48 h and analyzed the transcriptional response by single-cell RNA sequencing. Unsupervised clustering of pooled β cells identified subpopulations, including proliferating β cells. β-cell proliferation increased in response to oleate but not palmitate. Both fatty acids enhanced the expression of genes involved energy metabolism and mitochondrial activity. Comparison of proliferating vs. non-proliferating β cells and pseudotime ordering suggested the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxiredoxin signaling. Accordingly, the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine and the peroxiredoxin inhibitor Conoidin A both blocked oleate-induced β-cell proliferation. Our data reveal a key role for ROS signaling in β-cell proliferation in response to nutrients.},

Two competing models explain β cell dedifferentiation in diabetes. In the first model, β cells dedifferentiate in the reverse order of their developmental ontogeny. This model predicts that dedifferentiated β cells resemble β cell progenitors. In the second model, β cell dedifferentiation depends on the type of diabetogenic stress. This model, which we call the "Anna Karenina" model, predicts that in each type of diabetes, β cells dedifferentiate in their own way, depending on how their mature identity is disrupted by any particular diabetogenic stress. We directly tested the two models using a β cell-specific lineage-tracing system coupled with RNA-sequencing in mice. We constructed a multidimensional map of β cell transcriptional trajectories during the normal course of β cell postnatal development and during their dedifferentiation in models of both type 1 diabetes (NOD) and type 2 diabetes (BTBR-Lep ob/ob). Using this unbiased approach, we show here that despite some similarities between immature and dedifferentiated β cells, β cells dedifferentiation in the two mouse models is not a reversal of developmental ontogeny and is different between different types of diabetes.},

	abstract = {Multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have been generated to study pancreatic islet cells during development, homeostasis, and diabetes progression. However, despite the time and resources invested into the past scRNA-seq studies, there is still no consensus on islet cell states and associated pathways in health and dysfunction as well as the value of frequently used preclinical mouse diabetes models. Since these challenges can be only resolved with a joint analysis of multiple datasets, we present a scRNA-seq cross-condition mouse islet atlas (MIA). We integrated over 300,000 cells from nine datasets with 56 samples, varying in age, sex, and diabetes models, including autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) model (NOD), gluco-/lipotoxicity T2D model (db/db), and chemical streptozotocin (STZ) β-cell ablation model. MIA is a curated resource that enables interactive exploration of gene expression and transfer of cell types and states. We use MIA to obtain new insights into islet cells in health and disease that cannot be reached from individual datasets. Based on the MIA β-cell landscape we report cross-publication differences between previously suggested marker genes of individual phenotypes. We further show that in the STZ model β-cells transcriptionally correlate to human T2D and mouse db/db model β-cells, but are less similar to human T1D and mouse NOD model β-cells. We define new cell states involved in disease progression across diabetes models. We also observe different pathways shared between immature, aged, and diabetes model β-cell states. In conclusion, our work presents the first comprehensive analysis of β-cell responses to different stressors, providing a roadmap for the understanding of β-cell plasticity, compensation, and demise.},

Basic research on the genetic and molecular pathways regulating pancreas formation and function has gained major importance for the development of regenerative medical approaches aimed at improving diabetes treatment. Among the different model organisms that are currently used to elucidate the basic pathways of pancreas development and regeneration, the zebrafish is distinguished by its unique opportunities to combine genetic and pharmacological approaches with sophisticated live-imaging methodology, and by its ability to regenerate the pancreas within a short time. Here we review current perspectives and present methods for studying two important processes contributing to pancreas development and regeneration, namely cell migration via time-lapse micropscopy and cell proliferation via incorporation of nucleotide analog EdU, with a focus on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islet.},

Comparing the injury responses of regenerative and non-regenerative hearts reveals gene regulatory networks, cellular crosstalk, and secreted factors involved in the regeneration process. SUMMARY The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following injury, whereas the neonatal heart can readily regenerate within a short period after birth. Neonatal heart regeneration is orchestrated by multiple cell types intrinsic to the heart, as well as immune cells that infiltrate the heart after injury. To elucidate the transcriptional responses of the different cellular components of the mouse heart following injury, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on neonatal hearts at various time points following myocardial infarction and couple the results with bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data collected at the same time points. Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for enhancing cardiac function after injury.},

The ability of β-cells to couple insulin secretion to nutrient stimuli is acquired during a postnatal maturation process. In mature β-cells the insulin secretory response adapts to changes in nutrient state. Both β-cell maturation and functional adaptation rely on the interplay between extracellular cues and cell type-specific transcriptional programs. Here we review emerging evidence that developmental and homeostatic regulation of β-cell function involves collaboration between lineage-determining and signal-dependent transcription factors (LDTFs and SDTFs, respectively).

	abstract = {Objective: The effectiveness of bariatric surgery in restoring β-cell function has been described in type-2 diabetes (T2D) patients and animal models for years, whereas the mechanistic underpinnings are largely unknown. The possibility of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to rescue far-progressed, clinically-relevant T2D and to promote β-cell recovery has not been investigated on a single-cell level. Nevertheless, characterization of the heterogeneity and functional states of β-cells after VSG is a fundamental step to understand mechanisms of glycaemic recovery and to ultimately develop alternative, less-invasive therapies. Methods: We performed VSG in late-stage diabetic db/db mice and analyzed the islet transcriptome using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Immunohistochemical analyses and quantification of β-cell area and proliferation complement our findings from scRNA-seq. Results: We report that VSG was superior to calorie restriction in late-stage T2D and rapidly restored normoglycaemia in morbidly obese and overt diabetic db/db mice. Single-cell profiling of islets of Langerhans showed that VSG induced distinct, intrinsic changes in the β-cell transcriptome, but not in that of α-, δ-, and PP-cells. VSG triggered fast β-cell redifferentiation and functional improvement within only two weeks of intervention, which is not seen upon calorie restriction. Furthermore, VSG expanded β-cell area by means of redifferentiation and by creating a proliferation competent β-cell state. Conclusion: Collectively, our study reveals the superiority of VSG in the remission of far-progressed T2D and presents paths of β-cell regeneration and molecular pathways underlying the glycaemic benefits of VSG.},

Even though this heterogeneity has long been appreciated, only within the past 5 years have detailed molecular analyses led to an improved understanding of its basis. Although we are beginning to recognize why some subpopulations of endocrine cells are phenotypically different to others, arguably the most important consideration is how this heterogeneity affects the regulation of hormone release to control the homeostasis of glucose and other energy-r ich nutrients. The focus of this Review is the description of how endocrine cell heterogeneity (and principally that of insulin-secreting β-c ells) affects the regulation of hormone secretion within the islets of Langerhans. This discussion includes an overview of the functional characteristics of the different islet cell subpopulations and describes how they can communicate to influence islet function under basal and glucose-s timulated conditions. We further discuss how changes to the specific islet cell subpopulations or their numbers might underlie islet dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conclude with a discussion of several key open questions regarding the physiological role of islet cell heterogeneity.},

The most widely used insulin-secreting cell lines are RIN, HIT, MIN, INS-1 and βTC cells. These cells produce insulin and small amounts of glucagon and somatostatin.

            Heterotopic ossification (HO) is an aberrant regenerative process with ectopic bone induction in response to musculoskeletal trauma, in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) differentiate into osteochondrogenic cells instead of myocytes or tenocytes. Despite frequent cases of hospitalized musculoskeletal trauma, the inflammatory responses and cell population dynamics that regulate subsequent wound healing and tissue regeneration are still unclear. Here we examine, using a mouse model of trauma-induced HO, the local microenvironment of the initial post-injury inflammatory response. Single cell transcriptome analyses identify distinct monocyte/macrophage populations at the injury site, with their dynamic changes over time elucidated using trajectory analyses. Mechanistically, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1)-producing monocytes/macrophages are associated with HO and aberrant chondrogenic progenitor cell differentiation, while CD47-activating peptides that reduce systemic macrophage TGFβ levels and help ameliorate HO. Our data thus implicate CD47 activation as a therapeutic approach for modulating monocyte/macrophage phenotypes, MSC differentiation and HO formation during wound healing.},

Intravascular cell labeling, cell transplantation, and fate-mapping studies established that classical CD14+ blood monocytes derived from HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages. In contrast, non-classical CD16+ blood monocytes preferentially generated macrophages resident in the lung vasculature (pulmonary intravascular macrophages).

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from ’regularized negative binomial regression’, where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

Understanding the mechanisms behind β-cell failure is critical to prevent or revert disease. Basic pathogenic differences exist in the two forms of diabetes mellitus; T1DM is immune mediated and T2DM is mediated by metabolic mechanisms. These mechanisms differentially affect early β-cell dysfunction and eventual fate. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the field, mostly delivered by studies on β-cells in human disease. These advances include studies of islet morphology and human β-cell gene expression in T1DM and T2DM, the identification and characterization of the role of T1DM and T2DM candidate genes at the β-cell level and the endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling that contributes to β-cell failure in T1DM (mostly IRE1 driven) and T2DM (mostly PERK–eIF2α dependent). Here, we review these new findings, focusing on studies performed on human β-cells or on samples obtained from patients with diabetes mellitus.

To study mechanisms of β-cell loss in T2D, we performed islet single-cell RNA-sequencing of two obese mouse strains differing in their diabetes susceptibility. On a control diet, we identified six β-cell clusters with similar abundance in both strains. However, after feeding a diabetogenic diet for two days, β-cell cluster composition markedly differed between strains. Islets of diabetes-resistant mice developed into a protective β-cell cluster (Beta4), whereas those of diabetes-prone mice progressed towards stress-related clusters with a strikingly different expression pattern. Interestingly, the protective cluster showed indications of reduced β-cell identity, such as downregulation of GLUT2, GLP1R and MafA, and in-vitro knockdown of GLUT2 in β-cells to mimick its phenotype decreased stress response and apoptosis. This might explain enhanced β-cell survival of diabetes-resistant islets. In contrast, β-cells of diabetes-prone mice responded with expression changes indicating metabolic pressure and ER stress, presumably leading to later β-cell loss. In conclusion, failure of diabetes-prone mice to adapt gene expression towards a more dedifferentiated state in response to rising blood glucose levels leads to β-cell failure and diabetes development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although the mechanisms underlying β-cell dysfunction remain incompletely characterized, recent years have witnessed major advances in our understanding of the molecular pathways that contribute to the demise of the β-cell. Cellular and environmental factors contribute to β-cell dysfunction/loss through the activation of molecular pathways that exacerbate endoplasmic reticulum stress, the integrated stress response, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy. Whereas many of these stress responsive pathways are interconnected, their individual contributions to glucose homeostasis and β-cell health have been elucidated through the development and interrogation of animal models. In these studies, genetic models and pharmacological compounds have enabled the identification of genes and proteins specifically involved in β-cell dysfunction during diabetes pathogenesis.

Dysglycemia and type 2 diabetes results when islet β cells fail to maintain appropriate insulin secretion in the face of insulin resistance. To clarify the early transcriptional events leading to β-cell failure in the setting of obesity, we fed male C57BL/6J mice an obesogenic, high-fat diet (60\% kcal from fat) or a control diet (10\% kcal from fat) for one week, and islets from these mice (from four high-fat- and three control-fed mice) were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) analysis. Islet endocrine cell types (α cells, β cells, δ cells, PP cells) and other resident cell types (macrophages, T cells) were annotated by transcript profiles and visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) plots. UMAP analysis revealed distinct cell clusters (11 for β cells, 5 for α cells, 3 for δ cells, PP cells, ductal cells, endothelial cells), emphasizing the heterogeneity of cell populations in the islet. Collectively, the clusters containing the majority of β cells showed the fewest gene expression changes, whereas clusters harboring the minority of β cells showed the most changes. We identified that distinct β-cell clusters downregulate genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and upregulate genes associated with insulin secretion, whereas others upregulate genes that impair insulin secretion, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Moreover, all β-cell clusters negatively regulate genes associated with immune response activation. Glucagon-producing α cells exhibited patterns similar to β cells but, again, in clusters containing the minority of α cells. Our data indicate that an early transcriptional response in islets to an obesogenic diet reflects an attempt by distinct populations of β cells to augment or impair cellular function and/or reduce inflammatory responses as possible harbingers of ensuing insulin resistance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The Nlrp3 inflammasome has been implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance and beta cell failure. Endocannabinoids contribute to insulin resistance through activation of peripheral CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) and also promote beta cell failure. Here we show that beta cell failure in adult ZDF rats is not associated with CB1R signaling in beta cells, but rather in M1 macrophages infiltrating into pancreatic islets, and that this leads to activation of the Nlrp3-ASC inflammasome in the macrophages. These effects are replicated in vitro by incubating wild-type human or rodent macrophages, but not macrophages from CB 1 R-deficient (Cnr1-/-) or Nlrp3-/- mice, with the endocannabinoid anandamide. Peripheral CB1R blockade, in vivo depletion of macrophages or macrophage-specific knockdown of CB 1R reverses or prevents these changes and restores normoglycemia and glucose-induced insulin secretion.

	abstract = {In the developing embryo, appropriate patterning of the endoderm fated to become pancreas requires the spatial and temporal coordination of soluble factors secreted by the surrounding tissues. Once pancreatic progenitor cells are specified in the developing gut tube epithelium, epithelial–mesenchymal interactions, as well as a cascade of transcription factors, subsequently delineate three distinct lineages, including endocrine, exocrine, and ductal cells. Simultaneous morphological changes, including branching, vascularization, and proximal organ development, also influence the process of specification and differentiation. Decades of research using mouse genetics have uncovered many of the key factors involved in pancreatic cell fate decisions. When pancreas development or islet cell functions go awry, due to mutations in genes important for proper organogenesis and development, the result can lead to a common pancreatic affliction, diabetes mellitus. Current treatments for diabetes are adequate but not curative. Therefore, researchers are utilizing the current understanding of normal embryonic pancreas development in vivo, to direct embryonic stem cells toward a pancreatic fate with the goal of transplanting these in vitro generated ‘islets’ into patients. Mimicking development in vitro has proven difficult; however, significant progress has been made and the current differentiation protocols are becoming more efficient. The continued partnership between developmental biologists and stem cell researchers will guarantee that the in vitro generation of insulin-producing β cells is a possible therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.

To adapt to the constant and fast-changing demands for insulin production, β cells use the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum. Failure of these compensatory mechanisms contributes to both type 1 and 2 diabetes. Additionally, studies in which β cells are “rested” by reducing endogenous insulin demand have shown promise as a therapeutic strategy that could be applied more broadly.

Dependent on the type and concentration of agonist, it consists of either local or global calcium increases as well as spreading waves of calcium across the cell. In the past it has been speculated that these different calcium signals drive different secretory responses. Now, recent employment of two-photon microscopy has enabled the simultaneous recording of both enzyme secretion and calcium signals and is beginning to resolve this issue. The data shows that local calcium responses exclusively drive fluid secretion. Where-as, global calcium responses drive both fluid and enzyme secretion.

	abstract = {Objective
Pancreatic islets of Langerhans secrete hormones to regulate systemic glucose levels. Emerging evidence suggests that islet cells are functionally heterogeneous to allow a fine-tuned and efficient endocrine response to physiological changes. A precise description of the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, in particular linking animal models to human islets, is an important step towards identifying the factors critical for endocrine cell function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
Methods
In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 50′000 endocrine cells isolated from healthy human, pig and mouse pancreatic islets and characterize transcriptional heterogeneity and evolutionary conservation of those cells across the three species. We systematically delineated endocrine cell types and α- and β-cell heterogeneity through prior knowledge- and data-driven gene sets shared across species, which altogether capture common and differential cellular properties, transcriptional dynamics and putative driving factors of state transitions.
Results
We showed that global endocrine expression profiles correlate, and that critical identity and functional markers are shared between species, while only approximately 20\% of cell type enriched expression is conserved. We resolved distinct human α- and β-cell states that form continuous transcriptional landscapes. These states differentially activate maturation and hormone secretion programs, which are related to regulatory hormone receptor expression, signaling pathways and different types of cellular stress responses. Finally, we mapped mouse and pig cells to the human reference and observed that the spectrum of human α- and β-cell heterogeneity and aspects of such functional gene expression are better recapitulated in the pig than mouse data.
Conclusions
Here, we provide a high-resolution transcriptional map of healthy human islet cells and their murine and porcine counterparts, which is easily queryable via an online interface. This comprehensive resource informs future efforts that focus on pancreatic endocrine function, failure and regeneration, and enables to assess molecular conservation in islet biology across species for translational purposes.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is driven by the interplay of pro- and anti-inflammatory leukocytes in the aorta. Yet, the phenotypic and transcriptional diversity of aortic leukocytes is only poorly understood.

Objective
We characterized leukocytes from healthy and atherosclerotic mouse aortas in-depth by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) to define an atlas of the immune cell landscape in atherosclerosis.

Methods and Results
Employing scRNAseq of aortic leukocytes from chow (CD) and western diet (WD) fed Apoe−/− and Ldlr−/− mice, we detected 11 principal leukocyte clusters with distinct phenotypical and spatial characteristics, while the cellular repertoire in healthy aortas was less diverse. Gene set enrichment analysis on a single cell level established that multiple pathways, such as for lipid metabolism, proliferation, and cytokine secretion, were confined to particular leukocyte clusters. Leukocyte populations were differentially regulated in atherosclerotic Apoe−/− and Ldlr−/− mice. We confirmed the phenotypic diversity of these clusters with a novel CyTOF 35-marker panel with metal-labelled antibodies and conventional flow cytometry. Cell populations retrieved by these protein-based approaches were highly correlated to transcriptionally defined clusters. In an integrated screening strategy of scRNAseq, CyTOF, and FACS, we detected three principal B-cell subsets with alterations in surface markers, functional pathways, and in vitro cytokine secretion. Finally, we used leukocyte cluster gene signatures to enumerate leukocyte frequencies in 126 human plaques by a genetic deconvolution strategy. This approach revealed that human carotid plaques and microdissected mouse plaques were mostly populated by macrophages, T-cells, and monocytes. In addition, the frequency of genetically defined leukocyte populations in carotid plaques predicted cardiovascular events in patients.

Conclusion
The definition of leukocyte diversity by high-dimensional analyses enables a fine-grained analysis of aortic leukocyte subsets, reveals new immunological mechanisms and cell-type specific pathways, and establishes a functional relevance for lesional leukocytes in human atherosclerosis.},

In this Review, we highlight recent advances toward the development of diabetes therapies that target β cells to enhance proliferation, redifferentiation and protection from cell death and/or enable selective killing of senescent β cells. We describe currently available therapies and their mode of action, as well as insufficiencies of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and insulin therapies.

Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

The single-nucleus approach allowed us to recover all major cell types and to reveal distinct transcriptional stages along the entire adipogenic trajectory from preadipocyte commitment to mature adipocytes. We demonstrate the existence of different adipocyte subpopulations and show that obesity leads to disappearance of the lipogenic subpopulation and increased abundance of the stressed lipid-scavenging subpopulation. Moreover, obesity is associated with major changes in the abundance and gene expression of other cell populations, including a dramatic increase in lipid-handling genes in macrophages at the expense of macrophage-specific genes. The data provide a powerful resource for future hypothesis-driven investigations of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue plasticity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

How islet inflammation contributes to β cell loss remains uncertain. We have reported previously that chronic overnutrition-induced ER stress in β cells causes Ripk3-mediated islet inflammation, macrophage recruitment, and a reduction of β cell numbers in a zebrafish model. We show here that β cell loss results from the intricate communications among β cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Macrophage-derived Tnfa induces \textit{cxcl8a} in β cells. Cxcl8a, in turn, attracts neutrophils to macrophage-contacted "hotspots" where β cell loss occurs. We also show potentiation of chemokine expression in stressed mammalian β cells by macrophage-derived TNFA. In Akita and db/db mice, there is an increase in CXCL15-positive β cells and intra-islet neutrophils. Blocking neutrophil recruitment in Akita mice preserves β cell mass and slows diabetes progression.

We also find that each trajectory of the decision tree is defined by initial co-expression of alternative subtype molecular controls followed by gradual shifts toward cell fate resolution. Finally, analysis of both developing SGN and HC types reveals cell-cell signaling potentially playing a role in the differentiation of SGNs. Our results indicate that SGN identities are drafted prior to birth and reveal molecular principles that shape their differentiation and will facilitate studies of their development, physiology, and dysfunction.

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments.

By comparing with matching non-malignant lung samples, we reveal a highly complex TME that profoundly molds stromal cells. We identify 52 stromal cell subtypes, including novel subpopulations in cell types hitherto considered to be homogeneous, as well as transcription factors underlying their heterogeneity. For instance, we discover fibroblasts expressing different collagen sets, endothelial cells downregulating immune cell homing and genes coregulated with established immune checkpoint transcripts and correlating with T-cell activity. By assessing marker genes for these cell subtypes in bulk RNA-sequencing data from 1,572 patients, we illustrate how these correlate with survival, while immunohistochemistry for selected markers validates them as separate cellular entities in an independent series of lung tumors. Hence, in providing a comprehensive catalog of stromal cells types and by characterizing their phenotype and co-optive behavior, this resource provides deeper insights into lung cancer biology that will be helpful in advancing lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.

	abstract = {Organogenesis requires the complex interactions of multiple cell lineages that coordinate their expansion, differentiation, and maturation over time. Here, we profile the cell types within the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the murine pancreas across developmental time using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and genetic lineage tracing. We identify previously underappreciated cellular heterogeneity of the developing mesenchyme and reconstruct potential lineage relationships among the pancreatic mesothelium and mesenchymal cell types. Within the epithelium, we find a previously undescribed endocrine progenitor population, as well as an analogous population in both human fetal tissue and human embryonic stem cells differentiating toward a pancreatic beta cell fate. Further, we identify candidate transcriptional regulators along the differentiation trajectory of this population toward the alpha or beta cell lineages. This work establishes a roadmap of pancreatic development and demonstrates the broad utility of this approach for understanding lineage dynamics in developing organs. Coordinated proliferation and differentiation of diverse cell populations drive pancreatic epithelial and mesenchymal development. Here, the authors profile cell type dynamics in the developing mouse pancreas using single-cell RNA sequencing, identifying mesenchymal subtypes and undescribed endocrine progenitors.},

	abstract = {The mammalian brain develops through a complex interplay of spatial cues generated by diffusible morphogens, cell–cell interactions and intrinsic genetic programs that result in probably more than a thousand distinct cell types. A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1–8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system. A comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain between gastrulation and birth identifies hundreds of cellular states and reveals the spatiotemporal organization of brain development.},

To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing \&gt;1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space. Our freely available Python module and benchmarking pipeline can identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods and improve method development.

	abstract = {RNA velocity analysis of single cells promises to predict temporal dynamics from gene expression. Indeed, in many systems, it has been observed that RNA velocity produces a vector field which qualitatively reflects known features of the system. Despite this observation, the limitations of RNA velocity estimates are poorly understood. Using real data and simulations, we dissect the impact of different steps in the RNA velocity workflow on the estimated vector field. We find that the process of mapping RNA velocity estimates into a low-dimensional representation, such as those produced by UMAP, has a large impact on the result. The RNA velocity vector field is strongly dependent on the k-NN graph of the data. This dependence lead to large estimator errors when the k-NN graph is not a faithful representation of the true data structure; a feature which cannot be known for most real datasets. Finally, we establish that RNA velocity does not estimate expression speed neither at the gene nor at the cellular level. We propose that RNA velocity is best considered a smoothed interpolation of the observed k-NN structure, as opposed to an extrapolation of future cellular states, and that the use of RNA velocity as a validation of latent space embedding structures is circular.

Within islets, glucagon and somatostatin, released respectively from α- and δ-cells, modulate the secretion of insulin by β-cells. Dysregulation of insulin production raises blood glucose levels, leading to diabetes onset. Here, we present the genetic signature of human and mouse γ-cells. Using different approaches, we identified a set of genes and pathways defining their functional identity. We found that the γ-cell population is heterogeneous, with subsets of cells producing another hormone in addition to Ppy. These bihormonal cells share identity markers typical of the other islet cell-types. In mice, Ppy gene inactivation or conditional γ-cell ablation did not alter glycemia nor body weight. Interestingly, upon β-cell injury induction, γ-cells exhibited gene expression changes and some of them engaged insulin production, like α- and δ-cells. In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive characterization of γ-cells and highlight their plasticity and therapeutic potential. The cellular identity and function of the pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy)-producing γ-cells are incompletely understood. Here the authors show that these cells are heterogeneous and display adaptive plasticity to engage in insulin production following β-cell injury, but loss of the Ppy gene or γ-cells in mice does not affect weight or glycemia under basal conditions.},

Initial work studying β-cells suggested apoptotic β-cell death as a main contributor for the loss of β-cell mass in diabetes. Restoration of β-cells either by transplant or stimulating proliferation of remaining β-cells or precursors would then logically be a viable therapeutic option for diabetes. However, recent work has highlighted the inherent β-cell plasticity and the critical role of loss of β-cell identity in diabetes, and has suggested that β-cells fail to maintain a fully differentiated glucose-responsive and drug-responsive state, particularly in diabetic individuals with poorly controlled, long-lasting periods of hyperglycaemia. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of loss of β-cell identity and conversion in other cell types, as well as how to regain their mature differentiated functional state, is critical to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse these processes. In this review, we discuss the role of plasticity and loss of β-cell identity in diabetes, the current understanding of mechanisms involved in altering this mature functional β-cell state and potential progresses to identify novel therapeutic targets providing better opportunities for slowing or preventing diabetes progression.},

To date, there are more than a thousand software packages that have been developed to analyse scRNA-seq data. These focus predominantly on visualization, dimensionality reduction and cell type identification. Single cell technology is now being used to analyse experiments with complex designs including biological replication. One question that can be asked from single cell experiments which has not been possible to address with bulk RNA-seq data is whether the cell type proportions are different between two or more experimental conditions. As well as gene expression changes, the relative depletion or enrichment of a particular cell type can be the functional consequence of disease or treatment. However, cell type proportions estimates from scRNA-seq data are variable and statistical methods that can correctly account for different sources of variability are needed to confidently identify statistically significant shifts in cell type composition between experimental conditions. We present propeller, a robust and flexible method that leverages biological replication to find statistically significant differences in cell type proportions between groups. The propeller method is publicly available in the open source speckle R package (https://github.com/Oshlack/speckle).

	abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The autoimmune response against islet β- cells is believed to result from a disorder of immunoregulation. According to this concept, a T helper 1 (Th1) subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 1 cytokines-interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFβ), dominate over an immunoregulatory (suppressor) Th2 subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 2 cytokines-IL-4 and IL-10. This allows Type 1 cytokines to initiate a cascade of immune/inflammatory processes in the islet (insulitis), culminating in β-cell destruction. Type 1 cytokines activate (1) cytotoxic T cells that interact specifically with β-cells and destroy them, and (2) macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNFα), and oxygen and nitrogen free radicals that are highly toxic to islet β-cells. Furthermore, the cytokines IL-1, TNFα, and IFNγ are cytotoxic to β-cells, in large part by inducing the formation of oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite in the β-cells themselves. Therefore, it would appear that prevention of islet β-cell destruction and IDDM should be aimed at stimulating the production and/or action of Type 2 cytokines, inhibiting the production and/or action of Type 1 cytokines, and inhibiting the production and/or action of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals in the pancreatic islets.},

Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in NADH and ATP are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. INS-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism.

	abstract = {Pancreatic beta cell failure dictates the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes, with insulin secretion insufficient to overcome peripheral tissue insulin resistance. Over the past 5-10 years, a convincing case has emerged supporting the contribution of islet inflammation to this beta cell failure. IL-1 is central to this insult, impairing insulin secretion in preclinical and clinical studies. Further, islet-infiltrating macrophages are a major source of IL-1 and other cytokines in response to elevated levels of nutrients (glucose, saturated fatty acids), endocannabinoids and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). In this issue of Diabetologia, Butcher et al have further characterised immune cell subsets present in islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-013-3116-5). Increased numbers of CD45+ leucocytes were found in these islets compared with islets from healthy controls, with an elevated proportion of CD20+ B cells within the CD45+ population. Their data also suggest that absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells and CD11b+CD11c+ myeloid cells may be increased in islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes. While many aspects of islet inflammation await further exploration, the study from Butcher and colleagues suggests a role for immune cell-mediated inflammation early in disease pathogenesis, and supports the concept that targeting the immune system may slow continued beta cell demise in type 2 diabetes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, because reliable markers are limited. Hence, transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells. We also show that CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and beta cells with high purity.

We propose an agent-based model for the simulation of the autoimmune response in T1D. The model incorporates cell behavior from various rules derived from the current literature and is implemented on a high-performance computing system, which enables the simulation of a significant portion of the islets in the mouse pancreas. Simulation results indicate that the model is able to capture the trends that emerge during the progression of the autoimmunity. The multi-scale nature of the model enables definition of rules or equations that govern cellular or sub-cellular level phenomena and observation of the outcomes at the tissue scale. It is expected that such a model would facilitate in vivo clinical studies through rapid testing of hypotheses and planning of future experiments by providing insight into disease progression at different scales, some of which may not be obtained easily in clinical studies.

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Here, we conduct a thorough single-cell transcriptomics meta-analysis to identify robustly expressed markers used to build genesets describing the identity of human α-, β-, γ- and δ-cells. These genesets define islet cellular identities better than previously published genesets. We show their efficacy to outline cell identity changes and unravel some of their underlying genetic mechanisms, whether during embryonic pancreas development or in experimental setups aiming at developing glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells, such as pluripotent stem-cell differentiation or in adult islet cell reprogramming protocols. These islet cell type-specific genesets represent valuable tools that accurately benchmark gain and loss in islet cell identity traits. Cell therapy to replace β-cells is a potential therapeutic avenue to treat diabetes, but the production of insulin-secreting replacement cells requires reliable tools to assess islet cellular identity.

The disconnected picture of macrophage biology that has emerged from these observations is a barrier for integration across models or with in vitro macrophage activation paradigms. We set out to contextualize macrophage heterogeneity across mouse tissues and inflammatory conditions, specifically aiming to define a common framework of macrophage activation. We built a predictive model with which we mapped the activation of macrophages across 12 tissues and 25 biological conditions, finding a notable commonality and finite number of transcriptional profiles, in particular among infiltrating macrophages, which we modeled as defined stages along four conserved activation paths. These activation paths include a “phagocytic” regulatory path, an “inflammatory” cytokine-producing path, an “oxidative stress” antimicrobial path, or a “remodeling” extracellular matrix deposition path. We verified this model with adoptive cell transfer experiments and identified transient RELMɑ expression as a feature of monocyte-derived macrophage tissue engraftment. We propose that this integrative approach of macrophage classification allows the establishment of a common predictive framework of monocyte-derived macrophage activation in inflammation and homeostasis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The lack of understanding as to the cellular and molecular basis of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) has hindered the search for new effective therapies and biomarkers. Here, to address this gap, we analysed 740,000 single nuclei RNAseq profiles of 165 samples of white matter (WM) lesions, normal appearing WM, grey matter (GM) lesions and normal appearing GM from 55 MS patients and 28 controls. We find that gene expression changes in response to MS are highly cell-type specific in WM and GM lesions but are largely shared within an individual cell-type across lesions, following a continuum rather than discrete lesion-specific molecular programs. The major biological determinants of variability in gene expression in MS samples relate to individual patient effects, rather than to lesion types or other metadata. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+), we identify three subgroups of MS patients with distinct oligodendrocyte composition and WM glial gene expression signatures, suggestive of engagement of different pathological/regenerative processes. The discovery of these three patterns significantly advances our mechanistic understanding of progressive MS, provides a framework to use molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for best therapeutic approaches for progressive MS, and highlights the need for precision-medicine approaches to address heterogeneity among MS patients.

Reference datasets, however, are predominantly constructed from single-cell RNA-seq data, and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce ‘bridge integration’, a method to harmonize singlecell datasets across modalities by leveraging a multi-omic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multi-omic dataset comprises an element in a ‘dictionary’, which can be used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. We demonstrate that our procedure can accurately harmonize transcriptomic data with independent single cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to substantially improve computational scalability, and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach aims to broaden the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitate comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.

We found that intercellular signalling networks can be clustered into modules associated with specific cell subsets, and that biomaterial-specific responses can be characterized by interactions between signalling modules for immune, fibroblast and tissue-specific cells. In a Il17ra–/– mouse model, we validated that predicted interleukin-17-linked transcriptional targets led to concomitant changes in gene expression. Moreover, we identified cell subsets that had not been implicated in the responses to implanted biomaterials. Single-cell atlases of the cellular responses to implanted biomaterials will facilitate the design of implantable biomaterials and the understanding of the ensuing cellular responses.

How neural crest cells acquire such extraordinary lineage potential remains unresolved. By integrating single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of cranial neural crest-derived cells across the zebrafish lifetime, we observe progressive and region-specific establishment of enhancer accessibility for distinct fates. Neural crest-derived cells rapidly diversify into specialized progenitors, including multipotent skeletal progenitors, stromal cells with a regenerative signature, fibroblasts with a unique metabolic signature linked to skeletal integrity, and gill-specific progenitors generating cell types for respiration. By retrogradely mapping the emergence of lineage-specific chromatin accessibility, we identify a wealth of candidate lineage-priming factors, including a Gata3 regulatory circuit for respiratory cell fates. Rather than multilineage potential being established during cranial neural crest specification, our findings support progressive and region-specific chromatin remodeling underlying acquisition of diverse potential. Cranial neural crest generates a wide diversity of cell types. Here the authors perform single-cell profiling of neural crest to identify key enhancers and transcription factors for cell fate competency, thus revealing progressive acquisition of fate potential.},

Here we employed mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to obtain a comprehensive human immune cells landscape in the context of poor sleep, which was analyzed in the context of subset composition, gene signatures, enriched pathways, transcriptional regulatory networks, and intercellular interactions. Participants subjected to staying up had increased T and plasma cell frequency, along with upregulated autoimmune-related markers and pathways in CD4+ T and B cells. Additionally, staying up reduced the differentiation and immune activity of cytotoxic cells, indicative of a predisposition to infection and tumor development. Finally, staying up influenced myeloid subsets distribution and induced inflammation development and cellular senescence. These findings could potentially give high-dimensional and advanced insights for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pathologic conditions related to poor sleep.

	abstract = {Regular physical exercise has long been recognized to reverse the effects of diet-induced obesity, but the molecular mechanisms mediating these multi-tissue beneficial effects remain uncharacterized. Here, we address this challenge by studying the opposing effects of exercise training and high-fat diet at single-cell, deconvolution and tissue-level resolutions across 3 metabolic tissues. We profile scRNA-seq in 204,883 cells, grouped into 53 distinct cell subtypes/states in 22 major cell types, from subcuta-neous and visceral white adipose tissue (WAT), and skeletal muscle (SkM) in mice with diet and exercise training interventions. With a great number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) profiled, we compared depot-specific adipose stem cell (ASC) states, and defined 7 distinct fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP) states in SkM including discovering and validating a novel CD140+/CD34+/SCA1-FAP population. Exercise- and obesity-regulated proportion, transcriptional and cell-cell interaction changes were most strongly pronounced in and centered around ASCs, FAPs, macrophages and T-cells. These changes reflected thermogenesis-vs-lipogenesis and hyperplasia-vs-hypertrophy shifts, clustered in pathways including extracellular matrix remodeling and circadian rhythm, and implicated complex single- and multi-tissue communication including training-associated shift of a cytokine from binding to its decoy receptor on ASCs to true receptor on M2 macrophages in vWAT. Overall, our work provides new insights on the metabolic protective effects of exercise training, uncovers a previously-underappreciated role of MSCs in mediating tissue-specific and multi-tissue effects, and serves as a model for multitissue single-cell analyses in physiologically complex and multifactorial traits exemplified by obesity and exercise training.

Although there are various tools and methods to correct for batch effects, their performance can vary. Therefore, it is important to understand how batch effects manifest to adjust for them. Here, we systematically explore batch effects across various scRNA-seq datasets according to magnitude, cell type specificity, and complexity. We developed a cell-specific mixing score (cms) that quantifies mixing of cells frommultiple batches. By considering distance distributions, the score is able to detect local batch bias aswell as differentiate between unbalanced batches and systematic differences between cells of the same cell type. We compare metrics in scRNA-seq data using real and synthetic datasets and whereas these metrics target the same question and are used interchangeably, we find differences in scalability, sensitivity, and ability to handle differentially abundant cell types. We find that cell-specific metrics outperform cell type-specific and global metrics and recommend them for both method benchmarks and batch exploration.},

Results: Here, we present a single-cell Generative Adversarial Network (scGAN) to simultaneously acquire patterns from raw data while minimizing the confounding effect driven by technical artifacts or other factors inherent to the data. Specifically, scGAN models the data likelihood of the raw scRNA-seq counts by projecting each cell onto a latent embedding. Meanwhile, scGAN attempts to minimize the correlation between the latent embeddings and the batch labels across all cells. We demonstrate scGAN on three public scRNA-seq datasets and show that our method confers superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in forming clusters of known cell types and identifying known psychiatric genes that are associated with major depressive disorder.},

	abstract = {It is well recognized that batch effect in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a big challenge when integrating different datasets. Here, we proposed deepMNN, a novel deep learning-based method to correct batch effect in scRNA-seq data. We first searched mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) pairs across different batches in a principal component analysis (PCA) subspace. Subsequently, a batch correction network was constructed by stacking two residual blocks and further applied for the removal of batch effects. The loss function of deepMNN was defined as the sum of a batch loss and a weighted regularization loss. The batch loss was used to compute the distance between cells in MNN pairs in the PCA subspace, while the regularization loss was to make the output of the network similar to the input. The experiment results showed that deepMNN can successfully remove batch effects across datasets with identical cell types, datasets with non-identical cell types, datasets with multiple batches, and large-scale datasets as well. We compared the performance of deepMNN with state-of-the-art batch correction methods, including the widely used methods of Harmony, Scanorama, and Seurat V4 as well as the recently developed deep learning-based methods of MMD-ResNet and scGen. The results demonstrated that deepMNN achieved a better or comparable performance in terms of both qualitative analysis using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots and quantitative metrics such as batch and cell entropies, ARI F1 score, and ASW F1 score under various scenarios. Additionally, deepMNN allowed for integrating scRNA-seq datasets with multiple batches in one step. Furthermore, deepMNN ran much faster than the other methods for large-scale datasets. These characteristics of deepMNN made it have the potential to be a new choice for large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis.},

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases. Single-cell data are readily integrated with cell atlases using scArches.},

It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain.

Thus, single-cell data have a hierarchical structure that many current single-cell methods do not address, leading to biased inference, highly inflated type 1 error rates, and reduced robustness and reproducibility. This includes methods that use a batch effect correction for individual as a means of accounting for within-sample correlation. Here, we document this dependence across a range of cell types and show that pseudo-bulk aggregation methods are conservative and underpowered relative to mixed models. To compute differential expression within a specific cell type across treatment groups, we propose applying generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for individual, to properly account for both zero inflation and the correlation structure among measures from cells within an individual. Finally, we provide power estimates across a range of experimental conditions to assist researchers in designing appropriately powered studies.

	abstract = {Chronic, unresolved tissue inflammation is a well-described feature of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other insulin-resistant states. In this context, adipose tissue and liver inflammation have been particularly well studied; however, abundant evidence demonstrates that inflammatory processes are also activated in pancreatic islets from obese animals and humans with obesity and/or T2DM. In this Review, we focus on the characteristics of immune cell-mediated inflammation in islets and the consequences of this with respect to β-cell function. In contrast to type 1 diabetes mellitus, the dominant immune cell type causing inflammation in obese and T2DM islets is the macrophage. The increased macrophage accumulation in T2DM islets primarily arises through local proliferation of resident macrophages, which then provide signals (such as platelet-derived growth factor) that drive β-cell hyperplasia (a classic feature of obesity). In addition, islet macrophages also impair the insulin secretory capacity of β-cells. Through these mechanisms, islet-resident macrophages underlie the inflammatory response in obesity and mechanistically participate in the β-cell hyperplasia and dysfunction that characterizes this insulin-resistant state. These findings point to the possibility of therapeutics that target islet inflammation to elicit beneficial effects on β-cell function and glycaemia. The dominant immune cell type causing pancreatic islet inflammation in individuals with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus is the macrophage.

	abstract = {Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy and increases the risk of the offspring developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life. Alterations in the immune system are implicated in the pathogenesis of IUGR-induced T2DM. The development of the fetal immune system is a delicate balance as it must remain tolerant of maternal antigens whilst also preparing for the post-birth environment. In addition, the fetal immune system is susceptible to an altered intrauterine milieu caused by maternal and placental inflammatory mediators or secondary to nutrient and oxygen deprivation. Pancreatic-resident macrophages populate the pancreas during fetal development, and their phenotype is dynamic through the neonatal period. Furthermore, macrophages in the islets are instrumental in islet development as they influence β-cell proliferation and islet neogenesis. In addition, cytokines, derived from β-cells and macrophages, are important to islet homeostasis in the fetus and adult and, when perturbed, can cause islet dysfunction. Several activated immune pathways have been identified in the islets of people who experienced IUGR, with alternations in the levels of IL-1β and IL-4 as well as changes in TGFβ signalling. Leptin levels are also altered. Immunomodulation has shown therapeutic benefit in T2DM and might be particularly useful in IUGR-induced T2DM.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is characterized by the failure of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells (or β-cell death) due to either autoimmunity (type 1 diabetes mellitus) or failure to compensate for insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes mellitus; T2DM). In addition, mutations of critical genes cause monogenic diabetes. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary site for proinsulin folding; therefore, ER proteostasis is crucial for both β-cell function and survival under physiological and pathophysiological challenges. Importantly, the ER is also the major intracellular Ca2+ storage organelle, generating Ca2+ signals that contribute to insulin secretion. ER stress is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we summarize the mutations in monogenic diabetes that play causal roles in promoting ER stress in β-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for ER proteostasis imbalance with a focus on T2DM, in which both genetics and environment are considered important in promoting ER stress in β-cells. We also suggest that controlled insulin secretion from β-cells might reduce the progression of a key aspect of the metabolic syndrome, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, we evaluate potential therapeutic approaches to treat T2DM, including the optimization and protection of functional β-cell mass in individuals with T2DM. This Review summarizes the mechanisms by which endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to β-cell dysfunction and cell death in monogenic diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, the potential therapeutic strategies for T2DM and metabolic syndrome that target ER stress in β-cells are discussed.},

	abstract = {Spatial barcoding technologies have the potential to reveal histological details of transcriptomic profiles; however, they are currently limited by their low resolution. Here, we report Seq-Scope, a spatial barcoding technology with a resolution comparable to an optical microscope. Seq-Scope is based on a solid-phase amplification of randomly barcoded single-molecule oligonucleotides using an Illumina sequencing platform. The resulting clusters annotated with spatial coordinates are processed to expose RNA-capture moiety. These RNA-capturing barcoded clusters define the pixels of Seq-Scope that are ∼0.5–0.8 μm apart from each other. From tissue sections, Seq-Scope visualizes spatial transcriptome heterogeneity at multiple histological scales, including tissue zonation according to the portal-central (liver), crypt-surface (colon) and inflammation-fibrosis (injured liver) axes, cellular components including single-cell types and subtypes, and subcellular architectures of nucleus and cytoplasm. Seq-Scope is quick, straightforward, precise, and easy-to-implement and makes spatial single-cell analysis accessible to a wide group of biomedical researchers.},

We observe dynamic populations of cells, including several rare cell types and putative progenitors.

However, antibody performance and signal-to-noise ratio can differ considerably between FFPE tissues as a consequence of variations in tissue processing, including fixation. We investigated the effect of immunodetection-related signal intensity fluctuations on IMC analysis and phenotype identification in a cohort of twelve colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, we explored different normalisation strategies and propose a workflow to normalise IMC data by semi-automated background removal, using publicly available tools. This workflow can be directly applied to previously obtained datasets and considerably improves the quality of IMC data, thereby supporting the analysis and comparison of multiple samples.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a chronic age-related disorder characterized by hyperglycemia due to the failure of pancreatic beta cells to compensate for increased insulin demand, typically associated with peripheral insulin resistance. However, despite decades of research, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying T2D remain poorly defined. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) enables multiplexed assessment of the abundance and subcellular localization of multiple proteins on the same tissue section. Herein, we utilized IMC with a panel of 34 antibodies to quantify key markers of pancreatic exocrine, islet, and immune cells as well as stromal components. We employed this panel to analyze over 2.1 million cells from 16 pancreata obtained from donors with T2D and 13 pancreata from age similar non-diabetic controls. In the T2D pancreata, we observed significant alterations in islet architecture, endocrine cell composition, and surprisingly immune cell constituents. Thus, both HLA-DR positive CD8 T cells and macrophages were enriched intra-islet in the T2D pancreas. These efforts demonstrate the utility of IMC to investigate complex events at the cellular level in order to provide new insights into the pathophysiology of T2D.

Results: We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods. Conclusions: Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories. Accurate lineage inference is a critical step in the identification of dynamic temporal gene expression.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: It is widely accepted that production of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide in islet cells is specific to beta, alpha, delta and pancreatic polypeptide cells, respectively. We examined whether beta cells express other genes encoding islet hormones. Methods: Nested RT-PCR was performed on single beta cells of transgenic mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by mouse insulin I promoter (MIP-GFP). Results: Only 55\% of adult beta cells expressed the insulin gene alone, while others expressed two or more islet hormone genes; 4\% expressed all four hormone genes. In embryonic and neonatal cells, 60\% to 80\% of GFP+ cells co-expressed pancreatic polypeptide and insulin genes in contrast to 29\% in adult. To clarify cell fate, we conducted lineage tracing using rat insulin II promoter-cre mice crossed with reporter mice Gt(ROSA)26Sor-loxP-flanked STOP-cassette-GFP. All GFP+ cells expressed insulin I and II genes, and showed similar heterogeneity of co-expression to that seen in MIP-GFP mice. Although we report expression of other hormone genes in a significant proportion of beta cells, our lineage tracing results demonstrate that after inducing InsII (also known as Ins2) expression, beta cell progenitors do not redifferentiate to non-beta cells. Conclusions/interpretation: This study shows co-expression of multiple hormone genes in beta cells of adult mice as well as in embryos and neonates. This finding could: (1) represent residual expression from beta cell precursors; (2) result from alternative developmental pathways for beta cells; or (3) denote the differentiation potential of these cells. It may be linked to functional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity in gene expression may provide a means to characterise the functional, cellular and developmental heterogeneity seen in beta cells.},

Some cells express unexpected combinations of genes, and these expression patterns provide new insights into pancreas development. Following on these findings, we use PCR products from different cell types to identify novel pancreatic genes, some of which mark subtypes of developing pancreatic cells. By integrating these data with previous genetic and biochemical studies, we propose a pathway for pancreatic cell development. This form of single-cell transcriptional analysis can be applied to any developmental process or tissue to characterize distinct cell types.},

	abstract = {The study of organs and tissues on a molecular level is necessary as we seek an understanding of health and disease. Over the last few years, powerful highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches that rely on the serial imaging of tissues with fluorescently labeled antibodies and the simultaneous analysis using metal-labeled antibodies have emerged. These techniques enable analysis of dozens of epitopes in thousands of cells in a single experiment providing a systems level view of normal and disease processes at the single-cell level with spatial resolution in tissues. In this Review, I discuss, first, the highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches and the generated data. Second, I describe challenges that must be overcome to implement these imaging methods from bench to bedside, including issues with tissue processing and analyses of the large amounts of data generated. Third, I discuss how these methods can be integrated with readouts of genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and live cell information, and fourth, the novel applications possible in tissue biology, drug development, and biomarker discovery. I anticipate that highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches will broadly complement existing imaging methods and will become a cornerstone of tissue biology and biomedical research and of precision medical applications.},

Methods: From 118 autopsy cases with type 2 diabetes, 26 cases with islet amyloid deposition (DA+) were selected. Twenty diabetic subjects without obvious amyloid deposition (DA-) matched for the age and diabetes duration and 20 non-diabetic subjects (ND) served for comparison. We examined the severity of amyloid deposition and its relationships with population of endocrine cells, expression of cell damage markers or macrophage infiltration. Correlation of clinical profile with islet pathology was also sought on the subset of the investigated patients. Results: β-Cell volume density was nearly 40\% less in DA+ and 20\% less in DA- when compared to ND. Severity of amyloid deposition correlated with reduced volume densities of β-cell and α-cell, and increased body mass index (BMI), but not with duration of diabetes, age or HbA1c. Amyloid-rich islets contained an increased number of macrophages mixed with β-cells with oxidative stress-related DNA damage, characterized by γH2AX expression, and suppressed (pro)insulin mRNA expression. Conclusions: In Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, islet amyloid was more common with severe β-cell loss and high BMI, associated with macrophage infiltration. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

	abstract = {Activation of the innate immune system in obesity is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the notion that increased numbers of macrophages exist in the islets of type 2 diabetes patients and that this may be explained by a dysregulation of islet-derived inflammatory factors. Increased islet-associated immune cells were observed in human type 2 diabetic patients, high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice, the GK rat, and the db/db mouse. When cultured islets were exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu or when islets were isolated from high-fat-fed mice, increased isletderived inflammatory factors were produced and released, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, chemokine KC, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α. The specificity of this response was investigated by direct comparison to nonislet pancreatic tissue and β-cell lines and was not mimicked by the induction of islet cell death. Further, this inflammatory response was found to be biologically functional, as conditioned medium from human islets exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu could induce increased migration of monocytes and neutrophils. This migration was blocked by IL-8 neutralization, and IL-8 was localized to the human pancreatic α-cell. Therefore, islet-derived inflammatory factors are regulated by a type 2 diabetic milieu and may contribute to the macrophage infiltration of pancreatic islets that we observe in type 2 diabetes. © 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.},

The existence of doublets, which appear to be—but are not—real cells, is a key confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets, which contained experimentally annotated doublets, and 112 realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiencies. Our results show that existing methods exhibited diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects. Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection accuracy, and the cxds method has the highest computational efficiency. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information. We conduct a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. We evaluate the methods’ detection accuracy, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiency, using a comprehensive set of real and synthetic data. Although no method dominates in all aspects, the DoubletFinder and cxds methods have the best detection accuracy and computational efficiency, respectively.},

Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels. We performed an in-depth characterization of the spillover properties in mass cytometry, including limitations defined by the linear range of the mass cytometer and the reproducibility of the spillover over time and across machines. We demonstrated the utility of our method in suspension and imaging mass cytometry. To conclude, our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype artifacts. Signal spillover exists in mass cytometry and complicates the development of antibody panels and the interpretation of the data. Here, we characterize this spillover and its effects on the data. Further, we present an approach to estimate and correct for it, which was implemented in a newly developed R package called CATALYST. We show how this method can be used to correct for channel crosstalk in suspension and imaging mass cytometry data throughout the linear range of the instrument.},

Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.},

Furthermore, analysis of the Tabula Muris (organism-wide) atlas confirms our previous prediction that autocrine signalling is a major feature of cell-to-cell communication networks, while also revealing that hundreds of ligands and their cognate receptors are co-expressed in individual cells suggesting a substantial potential for self-signalling.},

Here we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint uses a neural network to simultaneously train labelled and unlabelled data and embed cells from both modalities in a common lower dimensional space, enabling label transfer and joint visualisation in an integrative framework. We demonstrate scJoint consistently provides meaningful joint visualisations and achieves significantly higher label transfer accuracy than existing methods using a complex cell atlas data and a biologically varying multi-modal data.

We find that T2D iMyos in culture exhibit multiple defects mirroring human disease, including an altered insulin signaling, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and reduced mitochondrial oxidation. More strikingly, global phosphoproteomic analysis reveals a multidimensional network of signaling defects in T2D iMyos going beyond the canonical insulin-signaling cascade, including proteins involved in regulation of Rho GTPases, mRNA splicing and/or processing, vesicular trafficking, gene transcription, and chromatin remodeling.

We identify two islet-resident macrophage populations, characterized by their anatomical distributions, distinct phenotypes, and functional properties. Obesity induces the local expansion of resident intra-islet macrophages, independent of recruitment from circulating monocytes. Functionally, intra-islet macrophages impair β cell function in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner. Increased engulfment of β cell insulin secretory granules by intra-islet macrophages in obese mice may contribute to restricting insulin secretion. In contrast, both intra- and peri-islet macrophage populations from obese mice promote β cell proliferation in a PDGFR signaling-dependent manner. Together, these data define distinct roles and mechanisms for islet macrophages in the regulation of islet β cells.},

	abstract = {Background: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other. Results: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plate-and droplet-based single-cell platforms. Conclusions: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.},

	abstract = {GM-CSF and M-CSF (CSF-1) induce different phenotypic changes in macrophage lineage populations. The nature, extent, and generality of these differences were assessed by comparing the responses to these CSFs, either alone or in combination, in various human and murine macrophage lineage populations. The differences between the respective global gene expression profiles of macrophages, derived from human monocytes by GM-CSF or M-CSF, were compared with the differences between the respective profiles for macrophages, derived from murine bone marrow cells by each CSF. Only 17\% of genes regulated differently by these CSFs were common across the species. Whether a particular change in relative gene expression is by direct action of a CSF can be confounded by endogenous mediators, such as type I IFN, IL-10, and activin A. Time-dependent differences in cytokine gene expression were noted in human monocytes treated with the CSFs; in this system, GM-CSF induced a more dramatic expression of IFN-regulated factor 4 (IRF4) than of IRF5, whereas M-CSF induced IRF5 but not IRF4. In the presence of both CSFs, some evidence of "competition" at the level of gene expression was observed. Care needs to be exercised when drawing definitive conclusions from a particular in vitro system about the roles of GM-CSF and M-CSF in macrophage lineage biology.

	abstract = {The adrenal gland is a composite endocrine organ with vital functions that include the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines. To define the molecular landscape that underlies the specific functions of the adrenal gland, we combined a genome-wide transcriptomics approach using messenger RNA sequencing of human tissues with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling on tissue microarrays. Approximately two-thirds of all putative protein coding genes were expressed in the adrenal gland, and the analysis identified 253 genes with an elevated pattern of expression in the adrenal gland, with only 37 genes showing a markedly greater expression level (more than fivefold) in the adrenal gland compared with 31 other normal human tissue types analyzed. The analyses allowed for an assessment of the relative expression levels for well-known proteins involved in adrenal gland function but also identified previously poorly characterized proteins in the adrenal cortex, such as the FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain containing 5 and the nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) protein homolog. We have provided a global analysis of the adrenal gland transcriptome and proteome, with a comprehensive list of genes with elevated expression in the adrenal gland and spatial information with examples of protein expression patterns for corresponding proteins. These genes and proteins constitute im-portant starting points for an improved understanding of the normal function and pathophysiology of the adrenal glands. (Endocrinology 158: 239–251, 2017)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-independent Cushing's syndrome is caused by tumors or hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. The molecular pathogenesis of cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas is not well understood. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing of tumor-tissue specimens from 10 patients with cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas and evaluated recurrent mutations in candidate genes in an additional 171 patients with adrenocortical tumors. We also performed genomewide copy-number analysis in 35 patients with cortisol-secreting bilateral adrenal hyperplasias. We studied the effects of these genetic defects both clinically and in vitro. RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed somatic mutations in PRKACA, which encodes the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A [PKA]), in 8 of 10 adenomas (c.617A→C in 7 and c.595-596insCAC in 1). Overall, PRKACA somatic mutations were identified in 22 of 59 unilateral adenomas (37\%) from patients with overt Cushing's syndrome; these mutations were not detectable in 40 patients with subclinical hypercortisolism or in 82 patients with other adrenal tumors. Among 35 patients with cortisol-producing hyperplasias, 5 (including 2 first-degree relatives) carried a germline copy-number gain (duplication) of the genomic region on chromosome 19 that includes PRKACA. In vitro studies showed impaired inhibition of both PKA catalytic subunit mutants by the PKA regulatory subunit, whereas cells from patients with germline chromosomal gains showed increased protein levels of the PKA catalytic subunit; in both instances, basal PKA activity was increased. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations of the catalytic subunit of PKA were found to be associated with human disease. Germline duplications of this gene resulted in bilateral adrenal hyperplasias, whereas somatic PRKACA mutations resulted in unilateral cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas.

The majority of these lesions are benign adrenocortical adenomas (80\%), characterized in 10-40\% of the cases by autonomous cortisol hypersecretion, and in 1-10\% by aldosterone hypersecretion. Several observational studies have shown that autonomous cortisol and aldosterone hypersecretion are more prevalent than expected in patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis: these patients have accelerated bone loss and an increased incidence of vertebral fractures. In contrast to glucocorticoid action, the effects of aldosterone on bone are less well understood. Recent data, demonstrating a concomitant co-secretion of glucocorticoid metabolites in patients with primary aldosteronism, could explain some of the metabolic abnormalities seen in patients with aldosterone hypersecretion. In clinical practice, patients with unexplained osteoporosis, particularly when associated with other features such as impaired glucose tolerance or hypertension, should be investigated for the possible presence of autonomous cortisol or aldosterone secretion due to an adrenal adenoma. Randomized intervention studies are needed, however, to investigate the optimum interventions for osteoporosis and other co-morbidities in these patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific bar codes (BCs), and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus, the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapse UMIs, either just for exon mapping reads or for both exon and intron mapping reads. If BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes but also allows the user to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analyzed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35\% of all reads map to introns. Also, we show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution. Conclusions: zUMIs flexibility makes if possible to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast, and user-friendly pipeline to process such scRNA-seq data.},

Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has made significant progress towards the unbiased and systematic identification of cell populations within a tissue, however, the characterization of their spatial organization within it has been more elusive. The recently introduced ‘spatial transcriptomics’ method (ST) reveals the spatial pattern of gene expression within a tissue section at a resolution of a thousand 100 µm spots across the tissue, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple cells. Here, we present an approach for the integration of scRNA-Seq and ST data generated from the same sample, and deploy it on primary pancreatic tumors from two patients. Applying our multimodal intersection analysis (MIA), we annotated the distinct micro-environment of each cell type identified by scRNA-Seq. We further found that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cancer cells have spatially restricted localizations across the tissue, as well as distinct co-enrichments with other cell types. Our mapping approach provides an efficient framework for the integration of the scRNA-Seq-defined subpopulation structure and the ST-defined tissue architecture in any tissue.},

Whether dedifferentiated β cells can be targeted by pharmacological intervention for diabetes remission, and ways in which this could be accomplished, are unknown as yet. Here we report the use of streptozotocin-induced diabetes to study β-cell dedifferentiation in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of islets identified markers and pathways associated with β-cell dedifferentiation and dysfunction. Single and combinatorial pharmacology further show that insulin treatment triggers insulin receptor pathway activation in β cells and restores maturation and function for diabetes remission. Additional β-cell selective delivery of oestrogen by Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1–oestrogen conjugate) decreases daily insulin requirements by 60\%, triggers oestrogen-specific activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation system, and further increases β-cell survival and regeneration. GLP-1–oestrogen also protects human β cells against cytokine-induced dysfunction.

Extrinsic pathway includes Fas pathway to CD4+-CD8+ interaction, whereas intrinsic pathway includes mitochondria-driven pathway at a balance between anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL and pro-apoptotic Bad, Bid, and Bik proteins. Activated cleaved caspse-3 is the converging point between extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. Apoptosis takes place only when pro-apoptotic proteins exceed anti-apoptotic proteins.

	abstract = {As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic errors that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic transformation such as cancer. Because aging reflects a stochastic process of increasing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difficult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary cells to derive insights into genetic and transcriptional processes that operate on aging human tissue. Aging is associated with increased transcriptional dysregulation and loss of identity at the single-cell level},

	abstract = {Cell fate acquisition is a fundamental developmental process in all multicellular organisms. Yet, much is unknown regarding how a cell traverses the pathway from stem cell to terminal differentiation. Advances in single cell genomics1 hold promise for unraveling developmental mechanisms2-3 in tissues4, organs5-6, and organisms7-8. However, lineage tracing can be challenging for some tissues9 and integration of high-quality datasets is often necessary to detect rare cell populations and developmental states10,11. Here, we harmonized single cell mRNA sequencing data from over 110,000 cells to construct a comprehensive atlas for a stereotypically developing organ with indeterminate growth, the Arabidopsis root. To test the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow . Although both transcription factors are required for early specification of cell identity12, our results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway acting in mature cells to specify endodermal identity, for which SHORTROOT is required. Uncovering the architecture of this pathway will provide insight into specification and stabilization of the endodermis, a tissue analogous to the mammalian epithelium. Thus, the atlas is a pivotal advance for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate organ development in space and time.

Utilizing an integrated strategy based on canonical correlation analysis of 5,265 scRNA-seq profiles, we identified 18 unique cell populations. Combining mass cytometry and transcriptomics revealed cell states expanded in RA synovia: THY1(CD90)+HLA-DRAhi sublining fibroblasts, IL1B+ pro-inflammatory monocytes, ITGAX+TBX21+ autoimmune-associated B cells and PDCD1+ peripheral helper T (TPH) cells and follicular helper T (TFH) cells. We defined distinct subsets of CD8+ T cells characterized by GZMK+, GZMB+, and GNLY+ phenotypes. We mapped inflammatory mediators to their source cell populations; for example, we attributed IL6 expression to THY1+HLA-DRAhi fibroblasts and IL1B production to pro-inflammatory monocytes. These populations are potentially key mediators of RA pathogenesis.},

Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we characterize the cellular composition of the lung during development and identify vast dynamics in cell composition and their molecular characteristics. Analyzing 818 ligand-receptor interaction pairs within and between cell lineages, we identify broadly interacting cells, including AT2, innate lymphocytes (ILCs), and basophils. Using interleukin (IL)-33 receptor knockout mice and in vitro experiments, we show that basophils establish a lung-specific function imprinted by IL-33 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), characterized by unique signaling of cytokines and growth factors important for stromal, epithelial, and myeloid cell fates. Antibody-depletion strategies, diphtheria toxin-mediated selective depletion of basophils, and co-culture studies show that lung resident basophils are important regulators of alveolar macrophage development and function. Together, our study demonstrates how whole-tissue signaling interaction map on the single-cell level can broaden our understanding of cellular networks in health and disease.

In this paper, we explore the phenomenology and mechanisms of background RNA generation in droplet-based scRNA-seq assays and present a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts mirroring those mechanisms. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. We implement the model along with a fast and scalable inference algorithm as the remove-background module in CellBender, an open-source scRNA-seq data processing software package.

In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell–cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol.

Single-cell and whole-islet transcriptomics analyses of immature β cells revealed remarkably diminished expression of β cell autoantigens and MHC class I components, and upregulation of immune inhibitory markers. IRE1α-deficient mice exhibited significantly fewer cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in their pancreata, and adoptive transfer of their total T cells did not induce diabetes in Rag1−/− mice.

We apply this approach to identify and compare the ligand-receptor interactions present in six syngeneic mouse tumor models. To identify interactions potentially associated with outcome, we regress interactions against phenotypic measurements of tumor growth rate. In addition, we quantify ligand-receptor interactions between T cell subsets and their relation to immune infiltration using a publicly available human melanoma dataset. Overall, this approach provides a tool for studying cell-cell interactions, their variability across tumors, and their relationship to outcome.

Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

However, the molecular signatures of immune cell populations over time in an autoimmune process remain poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we performed an unbiased examination of diverse islet-infiltrating cells during autoimmune diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse. The data revealed a landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity across the lymphoid and myeloid compartments. Memory CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells appeared early in islets, accompanied by regulatory cells with distinct phenotypes. Surprisingly, we observed a dramatic remodeling in the islet microenvironment, in which the resident macrophages underwent a stepwise activation program. This process resulted in polarization of the macrophage subpopulations into a terminal proinflammatory state. This study provides a single-cell atlas defining the staging of autoimmune diabetes and reveals that diabetic autoimmunity is driven by transcriptionally distinct cell populations specialized in divergent biological functions.},

Three-dimensional organoids generate complex organ-like tissues; however, it is unclear how heterotypic interactions affect lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in two-dimensional culture. We then derive three-dimensional liver bud organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during liver bud development. We find that liver bud hepatoblasts diverge from the two-dimensional lineage, and express epithelial migration signatures characteristic of organ budding. We benchmark three-dimensional liver buds against fetal and adult human liver single-cell RNA sequencing data, and find a striking correspondence between the three-dimensional liver bud and fetal liver cells. We use a receptor-ligand pairing analysis and a high-throughput inhibitor assay to interrogate signalling in liver buds, and show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) crosstalk potentiates endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation.

With continued growth expected in scRNA-seq data, achieving effective batch integration with available computational resources is crucial. Here, we perform an in-depth benchmark study on available batch correction methods to determine the most suitable method for batch-effect removal. RESULTS: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime, the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction efficacy while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are designed for the study: identical cell types with different technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple batches, big data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four benchmarking metrics including kBET, LISI, ASW, and ARI. We also investigate the use of batch-corrected data to study differential gene expression. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, Harmony, LIGER, and Seurat 3 are the recommended methods for batch integration. Due to its significantly shorter runtime, Harmony is recommended as the first method to try, with the other methods as viable alternatives.},

Our workflow offers different analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with a phenotype or changes in signaling markers within specific subpopulations, or differential analyses of aggregated signals. Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response; thus, we are able to model arbitrary experimental designs, such as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing overdispersion in cell count or aggregated signals across samples to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step, including quality control (e.g. multi-dimensional scaling plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses (e.g. plots of aggregated signals).},

	abstract = {Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates to form amyloid fibrils in patients with type 2 diabetes and acts as a potent stimulus for interleukin (IL)-1β secretion by bone marrow-derived macrophages. We sought to determine the contribution of resident islet macrophages to IAPP-induced inflammation and β-cell dysfunction. In cultured islets, macrophages (F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells) were required for IAPP-induced mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. Moreover, IAPP-induced IL-1β synthesis and caspase-1 activation were detected in macrophages but not other islet cell types. Transgenic mice with β-cell human IAPP (hIAPP) expression had impaired glucose tolerance, elevated islet Il1b mRNA, and decreased Il10 and Il1rn expression following high-fat feeding. Islet macrophages were the major source of these transcripts and expressed increased cell surface Ly6C and CD11c in hIAPP transgenic mice. Clodronate liposome-mediated depletion of islet macrophages improved glucose tolerance and blocked proinflammatory gene expression in hIAPP-expressing mice, despite increasing the amount of islet amyloid. These data provide the first evidence that IAPP aggregates skew resident islet macrophages toward a proinflammatory phenotype and suggest a mechanism by which anti-inflammatory therapies may protect β-cells from IAPP-induced islet dysfunction. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.},

Following SI tissue loss (as occurs in short gut syndrome, or SGS), remaining SI must compensate, or "adapt"; the capacity of SI epithelium to reprogram its regional identity has not been described. Here, we apply single-cell resolution analyses to characterize molecular changes underpinning adaptation to SGS. METHODS Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on epithelial cells isolated from distal SI of mice following 50\% proximal small bowel resection (SBR) vs sham surgery. Single-cell profiles were clustered based on transcriptional similarity, reconstructing differentiation events from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) through to mature enterocytes. An unsupervised computational approach to score cell identity was used to quantify changes in regional (proximal vs distal) SI identity, validated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, western blotting, and RNA-FISH. RESULTS Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection-based clustering and visualization revealed differentiation trajectories from ISCs to mature enterocytes in sham and SBR. Cell identity scoring demonstrated segregation of enterocytes by regional SI identity: SBR enterocytes assumed more mature proximal identities. This was associated with significant upregulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress gene expression, which was validated via orthogonal analyses. Observed upstream transcriptional changes suggest retinoid metabolism and proximal transcription factor Creb3l3 drive proximalization of cell identity in response to SBR. CONCLUSIONS Adaptation to proximal SBR involves regional reprogramming of ileal enterocytes toward a proximal identity. Interventions bolstering the endogenous reprogramming capacity of SI enterocytes-conceivably by engaging the retinoid metabolism pathway-merit further investigation, as they may increase enteral feeding tolerance, and obviate intestinal failure, in SGS.},

Identification of HEV in indigenous human infection and in domestic pig raising the possibility that HEV infection is also a zoonosis. OBJECTIVES/STUDY DESIGN: Molecular detection and epidemiology of HEV in humans (South-East Hungary) with acute hepatitis and in domestic (pig, cattle) and wild (boar and roe-deer) animals (countrywide) by ELISA and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2006, a total of 116 (9.6\%) of 1203 human sera were positive by HEV IgM ELISA and 13 (24.5\%) of 53 samples were also confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. Forty-two (27.3\%) of 154, 11 (34.4\%) of 32 and 9 (12.2\%) of 74 samples were RT-PCR-positive from swine (feces: 22.7\%; liver: 30.8\%), roe-deer (liver) and wild boar (liver), respectively. Except for an imported infection caused by genotype 1, 19 sequences (human: 12, swine: 4, roe-deer: 1, wild boar: 2) belong to genotype 3 HEV. Genetically identical strains were detected in human and roe-deer and in 2 other human clusters. CONCLUSIONS: HEV is an endemic agent in Hungary. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat-products is one of the possible sources of the indigenous HEV infections. Cross-species infection with genotype 3 HEV potentially involves a food-borne transmission route in Hungary.},

	abstract = {The anterior pituitary gland drives a set of highly conserved physiologic processes in mammalian species. These hormonally-controlled processes are central to somatic growth, pubertal transformation, fertility, lactation, and metabolism. Current models, based on targeted immuno-histochemical and mRNA analyses, suggest that each of the seven hormones synthesized by the pituitary is produced by a specific and exclusive cell lineage. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex model in which critical aspects of hormone specificity and plasticity of pituitary cells remain undefined. Here we have applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), in conjunction with a set of orthogonal imaging studies, to systematically map the cellular composition of adult male and female mouse pituitaries at single-cell resolution and in the setting of major physiologic demands. These analyses reveal sex-specific cellular diversity associated with normal pituitary homeostasis, and identify an array of specific hormone enriched cell-types and a series of non-hormone producing interstitial and supporting cell lineages. Unexpectedly, scRNA-seq further uncovers the presence of a major cell cluster that is characterized by a unique multi-hormone gene expression profile. The detection of dynamic shifts in cellular representations and transcriptome profiles within a number of these clusters in response to well-defined physiologic demands suggests their corresponding roles in cellular plasticity. These studies point to an unanticipated complexity and plasticity in pituitary cellular composition that may serve to expand upon current models and concepts of pituitary hormone gene expression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Single-cell transcriptomics is rapidly advancing our understanding of the cellular composition of complex tissues and organisms. A major limitation in most analysis pipelines is the reliance on manual annotations to determine cell identities, which are time-consuming and irreproducible. The exponential growth in the number of cells and samples has prompted the adaptation and development of supervised classification methods for automatic cell identification. RESULTS Here, we benchmarked 22 classification methods that automatically assign cell identities including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. The performance of the methods is evaluated using 27 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of different sizes, technologies, species, and levels of complexity. We use 2 experimental setups to evaluate the performance of each method for within dataset predictions (intra-dataset) and across datasets (inter-dataset) based on accuracy, percentage of unclassified cells, and computation time. We further evaluate the methods' sensitivity to the input features, number of cells per population, and their performance across different annotation levels and datasets. We find that most classifiers perform well on a variety of datasets with decreased accuracy for complex datasets with overlapping classes or deep annotations. The general-purpose support vector machine classifier has overall the best performance across the different experiments. CONCLUSIONS We present a comprehensive evaluation of automatic cell identification methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data. All the code used for the evaluation is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/tabdelaal/scRNAseq\_Benchmark ). Additionally, we provide a Snakemake workflow to facilitate the benchmarking and to support the extension of new methods and new datasets.},

This way, a large number of additional markers can still be used to further characterize the heterogeneity of DCs across tissues and during inflammation.

In particular, obese adipose tissue shows features characteristic of active local inflammation. At present, however, little is known about the sequence of events that comprises the inflammatory cascade or the mechanism by which inflammation develops. We found that large numbers of CD8(+) effector T cells infiltrated obese epididymal adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas the numbers of CD4(+) helper and regulatory T cells were diminished. The infiltration by CD8(+) T cells preceded the accumulation of macrophages, and immunological and genetic depletion of CD8(+) T cells lowered macrophage infiltration and adipose tissue inflammation and ameliorated systemic insulin resistance. Conversely, adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cells to CD8-deficient mice aggravated adipose inflammation. Coculture and other in vitro experiments revealed a vicious cycle of interactions between CD8(+) T cells, macrophages and adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that obese adipose tissue activates CD8(+) T cells, which, in turn, promote the recruitment and activation of macrophages in this tissue. These results support the notion that CD8(+) T cells have an essential role in the initiation and propagation of adipose inflammation.},

Because ingested sugars and fats can feed into many anabolic and catabolic pathways1, how our bodies handle nutrients depends on strategically positioned metabolic sensors that link the intrinsic nutritional value of a meal with intermediary metabolism. Here we describe a subset of immune cells—integrin β7+ natural gut intraepithelial T lymphocytes (natural IELs)—that is dispersed throughout the enterocyte layer of the small intestine and that modulates systemic metabolism. Integrin β7− mice that lack natural IELs are metabolically hyperactive and, when fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet, are resistant to obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we show that protection from cardiovascular disease in the absence of natural IELs depends on the enteroendocrine-derived incretin GLP-12, which is normally controlled by IELs through expression of the GLP-1 receptor. In this metabolic control system, IELs modulate enteroendocrine activity by acting as gatekeepers that limit the bioavailability of GLP-1. Although the function of IELs may prove advantageous when food is scarce, present-day overabundance of diets high in fat and sugar renders this metabolic checkpoint detrimental to health.},

Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process. Results: We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision.

Doublets occurring between distinct cell-types can appear as hybrid scRNA-Seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states.

	abstract = {This review describes the molecular alterations observed in the various types of tumors of the adrenal cortex, excluding Conn adenomas, especially the alterations identified by genomic approaches these last five years. Two main forms of bilateral adrenocortical tumors can be distinguished according to size and aspect of the nodules: primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD), which can be sporadic or part of Carney complex and primary bilateral macro nodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH). The bilateral nature of the tumors suggests the existence of an underlying genetic predisposition. PPNAD and Carney complex are mainly due to germline-inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A , coding for a regulatory subunit of PKA, whereas PBMAH genetic seems more complex. However, genome-wide approaches allowed the identification of a new tumor suppressor gene, ARMC5 , whose germline alteration could be responsible for at least 25\% of PBMAH cases. Unilateral adrenocortical tumors are more frequent, mostly adenomas. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway can be activated in both benign and malignant tumors by CTNNB1 mutations and by ZNRF3 inactivation in adrenal cancer (ACC). Some other signaling pathways are more specific of the tumor dignity. Thus, somatic mutations of cAMP/PKA pathway genes, mainly PRKACA , coding for the catalytic alpha-subunit of PKA, are found in cortisol-secreting adenomas, whereas IGF-II overexpression and alterations of p53 signaling pathway are observed in ACC. Genome-wide approaches including transcriptome, SNP, methylome and miRome analysis have identified new genetic and epigenetic alterations and the further clustering of ACC in subgroups associated with different prognosis, allowing the development of new prognosis markers.},

Although its physiological outcomes are not completely understood, this immunoreactive platform is crucial for precipitating islet autoreactivity in individuals carrying genetic risks, leading to the development of type 1 diabetes. In this Perspective, we summarize recent studies that examine the cross talk between the β-cells and various immune components, with a primary focus on discussing how antigenic information generated during normal β-cell catabolism can be delivered to the resident macrophage and further recognized by the adaptive CD4 T-cell system, a critical step to initiate autoimmune diabetes.

Here we show that a transient pulse of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in the islets during the priming phase of diabetes is sufficient to inhibit disease onset by promoting the expansion of intraislet CD4+CD25+ T cell pool. Approximately 40-50\% of intraislet CD4+ T cells expressed the CD25 marker and exhibited characteristics of regulatory T cells including small size, high level of intracellular CTLA-4, expression of Foxp3, and transfer of protection against diabetes. Results from in vivo incorporation of BrdUrd revealed that the generation of a high frequency of regulatory T cells in the islets is due to in situ expansion upon TGF-beta expression.

Islet-cells transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach based on in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to insulin-producing cells (IPCs). According to evolutionary stages in beta-cell development, there are several distinct checkpoints; each one has a unique characteristic, including definitive endoderm (DE), primitive gut (PG), posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic epithelium (PE), endocrine precursor (EP), and immature beta-cells up to functional beta-cells. A better understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRN) and associated transcription factors in each specific developmental stage, guarantees the achievement of the next successful checkpoints and ensures an efficient beta-cell differentiation procedure. The new findings in signaling pathways, related to the development of the pancreas are discussed here, including Wnt, Activin/Nodal, FGF, BMP, retinoic acid (RA), sonic hedgehog (Shh), Notch, and downstream regulators, required for beta-cell commitment. We also summarized different approaches in the IPCs protocol to conceptually define a standardized system, leading to the creation of a reproducible method for beta-cell differentiation. To normalize blood glucose level in diabetic mice, the replacement therapy in the early differentiation stage, such as EP stages was associated with better outcome when compared with the fully differentiated beta-cells' graft.},

	doi = {10.3389/fphar.2016.00083},
	abstract = {Type two diabetes (T2D) is a challenging metabolic disorder for which a cure has not yet been found. Its etiology is associated with several phenomena, including significant loss of insulin-producing, beta cell (β cell) mass via progressive programmed cell death and disrupted cellular autophagy. In diabetes, the etiology of β cell death and the role of mitochondria are complex and involve several layers of mechanisms. Understanding the dynamics of those mechanisms could permit researchers to develop an intervention for the progressive loss of β cells. Currently, diabetes research has shifted toward rejuvenation and plasticity technology and away from the simplified approach of hormonal compensation. Diabetes research is currently challenged by questions such as how to enhance cell survival, decrease apoptosis and replenish β cell mass in diabetic patients. In this review, we discuss evidence that β cell development and mass formation are guided by specific signaling systems, particularly hormones, transcription factors, and growth factors, all of which could be manipulated to enhance mass growth. There is also strong evidence that β cells are dynamically active cells, which, under specific conditions such as obesity, can increase in size and subsequently increase insulin secretion. In certain cases of aggressive or advanced forms of T2D, β cells become markedly impaired, and the only alternatives for maintaining glucose homeostasis are through partial or complete cell grafting (the Edmonton protocol). In these cases, the harvesting of an enriched population of viable β cells is required for transplantation. This task necessitates a deep understanding of the pharmacological agents that affect β cell survival, mass, and function. The aim of this review is to initiate discussion about the important signals in pancreatic β cell development and mass formation and to highlight the process by which cell death occurs in diabetes. This review also examines the attempts that have been made to recover or increase cell mass in diabetic patients by using various pharmacological agents.},

	abstract = {Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are aggressive cancers originating in the cortex of the adrenal gland. Despite overall poor prognosis, ACC outcome is heterogeneous. We performed exome sequencing and SNP array analysis of 45 ACCs and identified recurrent alterations in known driver genes (CTNNB1, TP53, CDKN2A, RB1 and MEN1) and in genes not previously reported in ACC (ZNRF3, DAXX, TERT and MED12), which we validated in an independent cohort of 77 ACCs. ZNRF3, encoding a cell surface E3 ubiquitin ligase, was the most frequently altered gene (21\%) and is a potential new tumor suppressor gene related to the Î 2-catenin pathway. Our integrated genomic analyses further identified two distinct molecular subgroups with opposite outcome. The C1A group of ACCs with poor outcome displayed numerous mutations and DNA methylation alterations, whereas the C1B group of ACCs with good prognosis displayed specific deregulation of two microRNA clusters. Thus, aggressive and indolent ACCs correspond to two distinct molecular entities driven by different oncogenic alterations. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have suggested that cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories in an asynchronous fashion during development. However, observations of cell flux along trajectories are confounded with population size effects in snapshot experiments and are therefore hard to interpret. In particular, changes in proliferation and death rates can be mistaken for cell flux. Here we present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that reconciles population dynamics with the concepts underlying developmental trajectories inferred from time-series single-cell data. Pseudodynamics models population distribution shifts across trajectories to quantify selection pressure, population expansion, and developmental potentials. Applying this model to time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing of T-cell and pancreatic beta cell maturation, we characterize proliferation and apoptosis rates and identify key developmental checkpoints, data inaccessible to existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations in protein kinase A catalytic alpha subunit (PRKACA) were found to be causative for 30-40\% of cortisol-producing adenomas (CPA) of the adrenal gland, rendering PKA signalling constitutively active. In its resting state, PKA is a stable and inactive heterotetramer, consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits with the latter inhibiting PKA activity. The human genome encodes three different PKA catalytic subunits and four different regulatory subunits that are preferentially expressed in different organs. In normal adrenal glands all regulatory subunits are expressed, while CPA exhibit reduced protein levels of the regulatory subunit IIbeta. In this study, we linked for the first time the loss of RIIbeta protein levels to the PRKACA mutation status and found the down-regulation of RIIbeta to arise post-transcriptionally. We further found the PKA subunit expression pattern of different tumours is also present in the zones of the normal adrenal cortex and demonstrate that the different PKA subunits have a differential expression pattern in each zone of the normal adrenal gland, indicating potential specific roles of these subunits in the regulation of different hormones secretion.},

	abstract = {Autoimmunity is a well-known pathogenic component in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The assumption that the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) also encompasses autoimmune aspects is recognized increasingly, based on the presence of circulating autoantibodies against β cells, self-reactive T cells, but also on the glucose-lowering efficacy of some immunomodulatory therapies in T2DM. The identification of these autoantibodies in elderly patients with slowly progressive manifestation of diabetes led to the introduction of a distinct clinical entity termed latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA), which combines features of both T1DM and T2DM. The autoantibody cluster differs in patients with LADA from patients with T1DM, but their presence indicates steady progression towards β-cell death and subsequent need for initiation of insulin treatment in a shorter period of time compared to autoantibody-negative T2DM patients. Autoimmune aspects in T2DM are not solely restricted to autoantibodies and thus LADA. They include the self-reactive T cells or defects in regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have been detected in autoantibody-negative T2DM patients as well. One contributor to the autoimmune activation in T2DM seems to be the chronic inflammatory state, characteristic of this disease. Upon inflammation-induced tissue destruction, cryptic 'self' antigens can trigger an autoimmune response, which in turn accelerates β-cell death. Both innate and adaptive immune system components, specifically macrophages and self-reactive T cells, contribute to an increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory and autoimmune processes. However, the extent to which inflammation overlaps with autoimmunity is not known. Our review focuses on autoimmune involvement in T2DM, with an emphasis on LADA and the humoral immune response, on the involvement of chronic inflammation in autoimmunity, and specifically the role of B and T cells as links between inflammatory and autoimmune reactions. We will further stress the consequences of autoimmune activation for T2DM patients and present novel therapeutic approaches for T2DM management that rely on immune modulation.},

However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly, our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes. As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological and clinical investigations. Bulk RNA-seq data harbors valuable information about gene expression levels from different cell types in tissue samples.
